destroyprobelegal_desc_0001=We've received intel from ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeInformant) that local criminal elements are operating ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) around ~mission(Location|Address) to eavesdrop on security forces. As such, authorization has been given to enlist private contractors to help eliminate these devices.  You'll need to carefully scan the area once you arrive to identify the exact location of the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount). Since they passively skim information, they can be tricky to find.\n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nWord of warning, outlaws tend to rig these PDC Monitors with defensive protocols to automatically back up the data when attacked, so once you start shooting, you'll need to destroy them all quickly before the transfer can finish.
destroyprobelegal_desc_0002=Independent combat operators are needed to eliminate unauthorized surveillance monitors placed around ~mission(Location|Address). According to the initial report, ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeInformant) has identified ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) intercepting data. Scanning the area for their location might be difficult since they have such low EM signatures, but they must be found and destroyed before sensitive intel is leaked. \n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)These 'skimmers' are outfitted with data security protocols. They will begin transferring the data they've gathered when threatened, so operators will need to destroy them before the upload is allowed to complete. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0003=We've received reports that criminal elements have installed ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) around ~mission(Location|Address) to spy on the area. Thankfully, we've finally been given the green light to hire combat operators to attack and destroy these systems. That's where you come in. \n\nYou will need to scan the area to find the PDC Monitors' location before the data illicitly gathered can be uploaded. The 'skimmers' will be in their passive data collection mode when you arrive making the search for them difficult, but know that once attacked, they will begin transmitting the contents of their drives. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0004=We are looking for experienced combat pilots to assist in the destruction of illegal surveillance systems that have been appearing in the sector. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)These outlaw 'skimmers' have contributed to the deaths of security personnel as well as civilians by providing local criminals with intel about security movements and deployments. \n\nYou will be tasked with scanning the area around ~mission(Location|Address) where ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeInformant) has indicated that you'll find ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) in operation. They will be well hidden thanks to their minimal power output. However, once engaged, these monitors will cease being covert and begin to upload their contents. You must destroy them before they complete the transfer otherwise highly sensitive data may be lost. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0005=Outlaw groups have been using ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) to spy on security forces by skimming data transmitted to and from ~mission(Location|Address). We are now actively seeking combat pilots to find and destroy these unauthorized 'skimmers.' ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)Know that it'll be difficult to hunt for their exact location since the monitors are design to only emit the barest of signatures and you may need to perform a thorough scan of the area. \n\nYou are to travel to the area, locate and then destroy all outlaw devices before any more innocent lives are lost. These PDC Monitors are outfitted with a failsafe program that will upload all data when attacked, so you will need to act before this process can complete. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0006=Combat pilots wanted to track and destroy unauthorized surveillance monitors. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)These outlaw PDC monitors are a threat to public safety and must be eliminated. You will find ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) near ~mission(Location|Address), but the exact placement remains unknown at this time. Only a careful on-site scan will be able to reveal exactly where these monitors are gathering intel. \n\nOur Security Officers have noted that the devices will start uploading their contents when attacked. We cannot let this data fall into criminal hands, so make sure you destroy them quickly. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)

dfm_ui_AdvMissileLocking=Dumb-fire missiles need no lock and fire instantly but have no tracking capability.\nHeat-seeking missiles require the target to remain in front of the ship for an amount of time dictated by several factors including your distance from the target and their infra-red emissions. Cross-section missiles (like the type your ship is armed with) focuses its tracking on the ships size and geometry. So the further away you are from the enemy, the harder it is for the missile to track.
dfm_ui_AdvMissileLocking_Title=Missile Locking (2/2)

dfm_ui_Control_Frame=The control frame reticle (CFR) shows the goal attitude that your ship is trying to attain. When torque/thruster error or other outside forces prevent the ship from attaining the goal the control frame reticle will deviate from the nose reticle. In these circumstances you should rely on the control frame reticle to pilot the ship as the forward velocity vector will always be in that direction. IFCS will then drive the nose reticle toward the CFR as it corrects the error.

dfm_ui_Countermeasures=When a missile is locked on your ship or an enemy is trying to achieve missile lock, you can attempt to break lock by using a countermeasure.\nTo fire a countermeasure hold [~action(spaceship_defensive|v_weapon_launch_countermeasure)].
dfm_ui_Countermeasures_Cont=\nCountermeasures are designed to disrupt specific types of missiles lock.\n~icon(Flare|22|22) The Decoy produces an intense burst of heat in an attempt to lure any pursuing heat-seeking missiles away from your ship. Decoys burn out quickly so missiles may reacquire lock-on if you fire on too early.\n~icon(Chaff|22|22) The Noise explodes into an expanding cloud of tiny filaments designed to confuse radar systems and break the lock of missiles with an electromagnetic lock-on system.\nYou can cycle the type of countermeasure armed by pressing [~action(spaceship_defensive|v_weapon_cycle_countermeasure_fwd)].

dfm_ui_FlightMode_Cruise_Mode=The mode above SCM is Cruise.\nThis is a high velocity mode that sacrifices control for speed. Use it to travel more quickly through the local area. It can take some time to reach maximum cruise velocity and even longer to stop with your retro thrusters so be sure to plan your decelerations accordingly.\nCruise is disabled during Basic Training.
dfm_ui_FlightMode_Cruise_Mode_Title=Flight Modes (3/4)
dfm_ui_FlightMode_Precision=The mode above Precision is Space Combat Maneuvering (SCM).\nThis is the typical mode used in combat and non-combat flight. Most of your flight time will be spent in this mode. Select this mode any time you wish to have the optimal balance of velocity and drift control.

dfm_ui_ITTS=With a target focused, your ship's targeting system will try to predict where you need to fire to hit the target with each of your weapons.\nIt does so by extending PIPs (Predicted Impact Point) from your Line of Sight reticule. Each PIP corresponds to a weapon and indicates where its projectiles will intercept given the distance and velocity of the target.\nPIPs are only predicted so if your target is far away it may alter its velocity and avoid the projectile. As a general rule, ballistic projectiles will take longer to reach a target than an energy projectile, therefore their PIPs will be projected further ahead.

distraction_desc_0001=Put down whatever you're doing and pay attention. This is a big one.\n\nThe ~mission(Client) got a massive score cooking, but in order to pull it off, they need an equally massive distraction. \n\nThat's you.\n \nYou're gonna head over to a ~mission(Location) and start nuking everything and everyone you can. ~mission(Wanted)You'll be making so much noise, no one will even care what the ~mission(Client) are up to.
distraction_desc_0002=You ever dream about flying out to some remote ~mission(Location) and shooting everything that moves? Well, guess what? I'm here to make your dreams come true. And not only that, I'm gonna pay you for it.\n\nI can't tell you all the specifics, but the upshot is that the ~mission(Client) are eager to make sure all the security in sector are kept as busy as possible.\n\nNow, it seemed to me that sending someone to rampage at the ~mission(Location) would be a damn good start. ~mission(Wanted)Shouldn't be too hard to keep everyone's attention after that.
distraction_desc_0003=The ~mission(Client) are looking to pay good credits for someone to create a distraction for them. And since I can't figure out how to lure a Vanduul fleet to the sector, a cutthroat like you flying to a ~mission(Location) and unleashing hell might be the next best thing. ~mission(Wanted)\n\nCan you believe some people choose to work in an office for a living?
distraction_desc_0004=Hey. Did you ever hear about the system-wide hunt in Ellis for that slicer a little while back? Advocacy were running in circles for days trying to take them down. Got me thinking. The ~mission(Client) are going after a huge score soon and then I thought, why not just arrange for something similar to happen here? Get all the security in the area chasing after a target so that they're blind to whatever else is going on. It would make the ~mission(Client) job a billion times easier. \n\nHere's how it'll work. You fly to a ~mission(Location) and unleash some major chaos and destruction. They already patrol places like that pretty heavily so you should have company in no time flat. ~mission(Wanted)To be honest, I'm starting to wonder if that thing in Ellis wasn't just a distraction, too.

distraction_wanted_0002=There's a caveat to this whole thing, though. With the amount of attention I want on you, your crimestat needs to stay at a level 5 minimum. It's the only way to guarantee that all eyes are on you. 
distraction_wanted_0003=Of course, an ordinary two-bit criminal won't be enough to get the whole sector engaged. No, you gonna need to rock a level 5 crimestat to create the chaos I'm after. 
distraction_wanted_0004=But the way I figure it, just showing up won't be enough. We need you to maintain a level 5 crimestat the whole time. That way we make sure every do-gooder in the sector will be racing to take you down.

distractionkill_desc_0001=I heard that you're big time now with your level 5. Normally, I'd be telling you to keep your head down and till the heat blows over, but it just so happens that I got a better use for you.\n\nI've been working on something big that's ready to go down, but in order to make it happen I need someone to create a distraction that's even bigger. That's where you come in. \n\nThe way I figure it, if you take out ~mission(KillCount) Navy humps, just about every screw in the entire Empire will be focused on dragging your ass down. \n\nCan't be lower sec either. Needs to be Navy to really pull this off. That's fine though, any security gets wind of a level 5 and they'll comm the Navy to come deal with you.\n\nAnd you have to do it fast enough so that the timing works out. As soon as you open fire on the first one, the clock starts.\n\nThink you can handle that?
distractionkill_desc_0002=I'll be honest with you, I usually don't like to deal with your kind of crazy, but a mad dog is exactly what I need right now. \n\nMy crew and I need all the security in the system kept busy for a while and the only way I see that happening is if you bring down enough Navy that they don't have a choice but to stop everything and focus on you. I think about ~mission(KillCount) starmen should do it. \n\nLucky thing is, with your level 5, they should be chasing you anyway. Security stops to scan you and the Navy's gonna come straight to you. Just make sure that once you start shooting that you finish the job. As soon as you engage with the first one, the clock starts and if you don't raise the stakes high enough, me and my crew are gonna be left hanging.\n\nOf course, feel free to kill even more of the bastards if the mood takes you.
distractionkill_desc_0003=Word on the wire is that every flattop with a badge is out there scanning the system for your level 5 wanted ass. What do you say to making some credits off all that hassle?\n\nI can't tell you exactly what's going down, but it's enough for you to know that I need a cataclysmic level distraction. The kind that can only be created by a dangerous and deranged criminal going on a shooting spree and taking out ~mission(KillCount) Navy starmen. \n\nOnce you start shooting, my crew will move into place, so you'll have to finish the job quick. And Navy only. Popping off some Advos or local security won't cut it. Fortunately, with your crimestat anytime you run into security, Navy shouldn't be far behind.\n\nGet this done for me, and I'll see that you get your fair cut.

dusters_claimsweep_desc_001=Some lucky slaggers discovered one hell of a valuable deposit over at ~mission(Location) near ~mission(LagrangeLocation) and now they’re trying their damnedest to get it all extracted double quick. \n\nOur thinking is that we should be the ones harvesting that lode.\n\nWe got all the equipment ready to go, just need someone to clear out all the pesky miners and the orbital sentries the bastards have protecting them. \n\nDo that for us, and we’ll give you a cut of the haul.
dusters_claimsweep_desc_002=One of ours was picking up some supplies when they overheard a miner placing a big order for the new dig they had set up over at ~mission(Location) near ~mission(LagrangeLocation). Was braggin' a bit too loudly about how much they were gonna make off the strike.\n\nWell, they may have found it, but no way in hell we’re gonna let them keep it. \n\nWe want you to clear all those miners and the sentries they have in place out of the way. With the haul we’re looking at, figure it’s worth spending some extra credits to hire someone good like you to take care of it.\n\nOnce you’ve sent them packing, we can come in and collect.
dusters_claimsweep_desc_003=We hit paydirt! Found ourselves one of the richest little veins of ore I’ve seen in years.\n\nThere’s one hitch, though. Some other idiots got there first.\n\nWon’t be a problem for long, the way I see it. \n\nAs soon as you haul over to ~mission(Location) located at ~mission(LagrangeLocation) and knock out the sentries guarding the place, we can go in and mine that site for all it’s worth. \n\nDon’t worry, we’ll pay you your cut off the top.

ea_popup_body_ModeDisclaimer=This is an 'Experimental Mode' where new features, mechanics, and modified existing game modes are tested. The purpose of this mode is to provide regular rotating content to Arena Commander and collect feedback to improve and adjust gameplay ahead of its release to the Persistent Universe.
ea_popup_body_ModeDisclaimer_MasterModes=This game mode is a special limited test used to collect feedback on several new features being developed for Star Citizen's flight model. It is not representative of the current Persistent Universe or intended final version of the game. You can view full details on the Spectrum link below.\n \nNew Features:\nMaster Modes - a new flight system which introduces two modes for combat and navigation: SCM & NAV.\nGunnery v2 - a collection of gunnery and targeting changes such as weapon tuning, gimbal mode effects, auto-targeting functionality, new UI, and the removal of gimbal size limitations.\nTargeting v2 – new holographic UI and bindings including the addition of auto-targeting.\n \nFor this test you will be piloting a specially outfitted Gladius with 2 x S3 Gimbaled Laser Repeaters and a S3 Ballistic Gatling. This Gladius’ loadout cannot be altered and has been tuned specifically for Master Modes with increased agility, boost and shield regen adjustments as well as the shield profile being changed to Front/Back. \n \nDefault Bindings: ~action(spaceship_movement|v_master_mode_cycle) to change Master Modes, ~action(spaceship_targeting|v_auto_targeting_enable_short) to enable Auto-Targeting\n
