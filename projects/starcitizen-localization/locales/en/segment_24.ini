We take them out and the area should be clear again.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetBattle_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_005_GladYoureWith=Glad you're with us on this. Not going to be easy facing down this Nine Tails fleet, but we take these ships out and we take the quantum dampener out with them. Then this damn blockade will finally be over. Head to the coordinates and let's get this done.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousAbandon_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_001_LookHereI=Look here. I know that last time the Nine Tails blockaded a station and you volunteered to assist Crusader Security things didn't exactly work out. I'm willing to give you another chance though. Head to the first scan area and I expect you to help secure the site. Don't let me down this time.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousAbandon_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_002_AllRightPilot=All right, pilot. Let's not beat around the bush - last time you offered to help with a Nine Tails blockade you were less than reliable. But these bastards are at it again, and I need every ship I can get. Head to the first scan point, and lets see if you can help us locate their fleet.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousAbandon_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_003_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman. I'm surprised to see you're volunteering again. Last time there was a Nine Tails blockade you left us high and dry. But if there's one thing I've learned is that if someone asks for a chance to prove themselves, you might as well let them try. If you're serious about helping this time, we need to secure the first scan point so we can try and locate the main fleet. We'll see if you can do better this time around.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousFail_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_001_CommanderHerdsmanHere=Commander Herdsman here. Thanks for volunteering. I know the last time the Nine Tails blockaded a station we weren't able to capture those responsible, but I'm confident that we can do better this time around. First we got to find their fleet, though. I'm sending you the coordinates for the first scan location. See you there.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousFail_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_002_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman. Thanks for offering to help end this blockade. I know the Nine Tails got the better of us last time, but that was then and this is now.  If we focus and give a hundred and ten percent, I have every confidence that we can stop them. First though, we have to secure the initial scan point so we can locate their fleet. Head over there now.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousFail_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_003_ISeeThat=I see that you'll be joining us to put an end to the lastest Nine Tails' blockade attempt. Here's hoping things go better for us this time. I sent you the coordinates for our first scan point. Make your way to the site. We will need to secure it to begin searching for their fleet.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousSucceedWell_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_001_IWasDamn=I was damn glad to see your name pop up. Crusader Security hasn't forgotten your vital contributions to shutting down the Nine Tails last time they tried something like this. Head to the first scan area and let's see if we cant end this blockade like we did the last one.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousSucceedWell_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_002_RealHappyTo=Real happy to have you with us again. With you on board, I'm sure we'll be just as successful shutting down the Nine Tails blockade this time around. Head to the first scan area and we'll start hunting for their fleet's location. See you there.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousSucceedWell_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_003_NiceToHave=Nice to have you fighting with us again. Hopefully we can destroy their fleet as successfully as we did last time. Sending you the location of the first point we will need to scan. Head to the coordinates and secure the site.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousSucceed_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_001_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman. Very happy to see that you're voluteering again. Nine Tails seem to think they'll have a better chance this time around, but with pilots like you rejoining the fight they're sorely mistaken. First things first, we got to secure the initial scan point before we can locate their fleet. I'll see you there.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousSucceed_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_002_CommanderHerdsmanHere=Commander Herdsman, here. Glad to have you back on board. With how we successfully dealt with the Nine Tails last time around, I have every bit of faith that this current blockade will be shut down with the same efficiency. Let's not waste any time, head to the first scan point and we'll begin our search for the Nine Tails fleet.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousSucceed_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_003_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman. I hoped the Nine Tails would've learned their lesson after we took care of their last blockade. Guess I shouldn't be surprised they're at it again. But just like last time, we'll shut them down again. Head to the first scan point and we'll begin searching for their main fleet.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_FirstOccur_IG_001_GladYoullBe=Glad you'll be joining us. We need all the help we can get. I'm Commander Herdsman with Crusader Security and I'll be overseeing this op. The plan is to use scan ships to help us locate whatever the Nine Tails are using to block quantum travel, but we can't do that until we clear a safe zone for the scanners to operate. You have the coordinates of the first scan site. Make your way there now.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_001_CommanderHerdsmanHere=Commander Herdsman here. Good to have you with us. Crusader Security needs to trace the current location of the main Nine Tails fleet, but can't get our scan ships into position until active hostiles have been cleared. Head to the coordinates now.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_002_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman. Nice to see you will be joining Crusader Security for this operation. I have scan ships at the ready to help us locate the main Nine Tails fleet and put an end to this blockade, but we can't begin the scans until we can secure the location. Report to the provided coordinates.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_003_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman of Crusader Security. I'm coordinating a protective detail to secure a scan site so we can locate the source of this Nine Tails blockade. Head to the location provided now. And be ready for a fight.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_004_CommanderHerdsmanHere=Commander Herdsman here. I'm happy to see you're joining Crusader Security's efforts to end this blockade. First step will be to ascertain the Nine Tails fleet's location using scan ships. But it will be too risky to deploy them until we can fully secure the scan site. Head there now to assist with clearing any hostiles.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_005_CommanderHerdsmanHere=Commander Herdsman here. You've got the coordinates of the scan site I need you to clear. Once we are sure there are no active hostiles we can begin scanning, find the Nine Tails fleet, and hopefully put a stop to this blockade once and for all. Report to the site as soon as possible.
