ea_ui_map_description=Map Description
ea_ui_map_name=Map Name
ea_ui_mapdesc_BrokenMoon=Formerly part of Kellar's Run, Taranis system is one of the more notorious and dangerous places in the known systems. The vast fields of asteroids offer plenty of hiding places for assassins and bushwhackers.
ea_ui_mapdesc_CaplanCircuit=Race through the intricate framework and sharp turns of the Caplan Industrial Platform, just a short flight away from the August Dunlow Spaceport. The Caplan Circuit is a rite of passage for all local racers.
ea_ui_mapdesc_Crossroads=Discovered in 2445, the United Nations of Earth was conflicted about what to do with the Nexus system. Since the only jump point at the time was through Cathcart, they tried to use the system as a dedicated military training system, but budget issues forced the government to sell exclusive access to the system to the Hathor Group in a deal that ultimately inspired the sale of Stanton System centuries later. Hathor indiscriminately stripped the system of its resources then abandoned it. Over the decades, outlaws, squatters, and refugees began to move in as the system slipped into obscurity. It wasn’t until 2931 when Dean Kellar’s infamous run that the UEE realized how dangerous and entrenched these criminals had become and decided to take it back.\n\nThe year is now 2934. The UEE is still attempting to restore order by sweeping out the outlaws and squatters who have taken residence in the system. Play as a member of the UEE Advocacy tactical team, led by SAC Darrell Lincoln, or an outlaw in the Supreme gang, led by Leoni “Zombie” Kulkov, in the battle for the Hathor Mining Facility on Nexus III.
ea_ui_mapdesc_Demien=Originally built by the Hathor Group for the workers attempting to terraform Nexus II, OP Station Demien has earned a much darker reputation as the site of the infamous Walzer Massacre of 2935.
ea_ui_mapdesc_DemienComms=Originally built by the Hathor Group for the workers attempting to terraform Nexus II, OP Station Demien has earned a much darker reputation as the site of the infamous Walzer Massacre of 2935. The Comms Center was a main hub of the station.
ea_ui_mapdesc_DogfightTest=Special map for Dogfight Testing
ea_ui_mapdesc_DunlowDerby=Inspired by the real life underground race through the heart of Orison, this sim map allows pilots to test their mettle and precision handling skills without endangering the local Crusader populace.
ea_ui_mapdesc_DyingStar=Pyro system didn't get its name by accident. The central star is in the middle of the prolonged nova phase, burning out the planets in the system. While dangerous, it's a morbid kind of beauty.
ea_ui_mapdesc_Echo11=A former extraction facility, Echo Eleven was abandoned when the Hathor Group left the Nexus system and has since become a vile den of squatters and outlaws.
ea_ui_mapdesc_GroundArena=A battleground fit for determining which tank or team will reign supreme. 
ea_ui_mapdesc_Icebreaker=Face off against the frigid winds that cover the mountains of the Euterpe Advanced Research Laboratories or bide your time and hope the weather clears. Whatever your choice, know that the Icebreaker takes no prisoners. 
ea_ui_mapdesc_JerichoStation=Completed in 2871, INS Jericho is the main port of call for the UEE Navy in the Stanton system. Named after famed squadron leader Amare Jericho, this station is outfitted to provide logistical support, refueling and resupply options for a variety of capital ships, as well as smaller support and combat vessels.
ea_ui_mapdesc_Kareah=Security Post Kareah was heralded as a next-generation policing station for Crusader Security, yet years of budget shortfalls left it unfinished. Eager to stem the tide of outlaws eager to exploit the station’s connection to the Advocacy’s secure data network, Crusader Security has recently begun using the facility as a heavily-guarded, evidence storage depot.
ea_ui_mapdesc_LorvilleOutskirts=A sprawling network of interworking cranes, pipes, and industrial machinery line the winding quarry of this active worksite that doubles as the Lorville Outskirts racetrack.
ea_ui_mapdesc_MinersLament=Brave this eerie racetrack on the edge of Yela's asteroid belt. Once the site of a tragic mining disaster, the forsaken machinery and floating derelicts of Miner's Lament will now put your skills and your nerve to the test.
ea_ui_mapdesc_NHS_DeffordLink=A dangerous course that has claimed many aspiring pilots' ships. This crucible isn't always in the Murray Cup's rotation of tracks. Many feel that it's too difficult and unnecessarily risks pilots for better spec broadcasting.
ea_ui_mapdesc_NHS_HalloranCircuit=One of the newest tracks added to the Murray Cup’s rotation, Halloran Circuit’s death-defying turns and dives have made it a fan favorite, drawing incredible viewership to its spectrum broadcasts.
ea_ui_mapdesc_NHS_OldVanderval=One of the oldest active courses in racing. It's no longer considered an eligible race track, so any race here is considered Clean (a term which can encapsulate any amateur, non-pro or underground race). Most pilots have cut their teeth on Old Van so it's one of the more beloved tracks in the Empire.
ea_ui_mapdesc_NHS_RikkordMemorial=A standard fixture in Murray Cup qualifiers, Rikkord Memorial has always been a great separator between the amateurs and the professionals.
ea_ui_mapdesc_NHS_WinnersCircle=The popular sim map, Winner’s Circle, transforms the iconic aesthetic of the New Horizon Speedway into a combat arena, perfect for honing atmospheric maneuvers and dogfighting skills.
ea_ui_mapdesc_RiverZero=A scenic course that follows the natural bends of the River Zero on microTech. Its natural beauty can be distracting to pilots attempting to follow its winding path while staying above the water but below the tree tops. 
ea_ui_mapdesc_SkyScraper=Challenge the skies above Area18 and conquer the Sky Scraper by narrowly threading your way through towering high-rises and dense urban-sprawl at breakneck speeds.
ea_ui_mapdesc_SnakePit=Weave around pylons, duck under cranes, and avoid precarious pipes in this abandoned mining facility as you strive to prevail over the Snake Pit and its venomous turns.
ea_ui_mapdesc_TheGoodDoctor=Hatfield & Harding had big plans for planet of Mya in the Leir System when they purchased it from Galor Messer IX in 2743. They entrusted the supervision of the terraforming and settlement to Dr. Marcus Fayel from the University of Persei’s Analytical Research and Quantification campus. Little did they know that Dr. Fayel would not only betray his employees, but he would steal the planet out from under them. On May 3, 2812, all communication with the planet was cut off. Hours later, a single message from Dr. Fayel directed to Hatfield & Harding and the rest of the universe announcing the birth of the Sun’s Eye Fellowship, a new religion based on radical isolationism, and their intent to claim Mya as their own.\n\nFayel’s former employers were furious. Against the wishes of the UEE, they assembled a covert team of mercenaries to secure the planet and eliminate Fayel as well as any followers who got in their way. The operation was a brutal massacre. The Fellowship proved to be more than willing to kill and die for their new leader. The mission’s failure led to the eventual dissolution of Hatfield & Harding and complete control of Mya to Fayel and the Fellowship who became known as the Outsiders.

fine_terminal_informationScreen_Info=\nHow are fines attributed to me?\nMost fines are issued directly by members of law enforcement, but some result from violations detected by ships and mobiGlas and automatically broadcast to the Emergency Communication Network (ECN) system.\n\n\nWhat sort of things can I get fined for?\nFor a complete list of finable offenses and misdemeanors applicable in your current jurisdiction, please consult your mobiGlas.\n\n\nWhy did I receive a fine for something legal elsewhere?\nCertain jurisdictions have different laws. You should always check the legality of your cargo when entering a new jurisdiction.\n\n\nMy ship was stolen, why am I still receiving fines?\nUnless you report your vehicle stolen to law enforcement (this can be easily done at an ASOP terminal), you are still considered the legal owner of the ship and are responsible for certain crimes perpetrated by it.\n\n\nWhy does the Escalated Fine cost more than the initial price?\nTo encourage prompt payment, the Office of Imperial Justice (OIJ) provides offenders a short period where newly acquired fines may be settled at a discounted initial rate. If payment is not made before this period expires, the fine escalates in both price and severity.\n\n\nWhat happens if I don’t pay my Escalated Fines?\nIf you accumulate enough unpaid escalated fines you will be issued a crimestat. The heavier your escalated fines, the faster this will happen. The OIJ strongly urges everyone to pay their fines regularly and on time.\n\n\nWhat if I receive a fine in error?\nIf you think you have received a fine in error, please contact the Issue Council. While mistakes are rare, we are trying to improve the system all the time and your feedback is welcome.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_corsair_desc=We at Drake Interplanetary know that sometimes defense isn’t just about protecting what’s yours. Sometimes it’s about striking out and facing the unknown head-on. How can you ever be truly safe if you don’t know what threat is waiting beyond the next mountain range, moon, or jump point? \n\nThanks to a large hold capable of stowing a small vehicle and specially designed asymmetric convertible wings, the Corsair adapts gracefully to unfamiliar atmospheres, combat situations, and hot landing zones. Be ready for anything, and you’ll never be caught unprepared.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_g12_desc=While larger vehicles like the Tumbril Nova and Anvil Ballista may be better known for their military might, the UEE deploys thousands of smaller tactical vehicles in defense of the Empire. More easily transported to provide greater mission flexibility, these rovers and gravlevs often allow tactical responsiveness to a wider variety of terrain and scenarios. When atmospheric conditions become hostile and can impede flight, having a varied motor pool at your disposal can make all the difference.\n\nOne of the newest rovers to join the ranks is the G12a from Origin Jumpworks. While it may have the sleek lines the manufacturer is known for, the G12a is reinforced with heavier armor and fortified wheels, and comes armed with a full defensive and offensive suite. When deployed, it will initially serve as a patrol vehicle for landing sites located in active combat areas with severe weather patterns.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_hercules_desc=The first active-duty starlifter flight was formed in May 2821, when Crusader Industries delivered a dozen Hercules ships during that year’s Invictus Launch Week. Capable of deploying armored vehicles in the midst of heavy enemy fire, the Hercules proved invaluable to battlefield operations. This was apparent on March 2824, when UEE armed forces were called upon to put down a heavily armed group of pirate forces located on a frontier world near the Xi’an border. Two Hercules squadrons, escorted by deep space support fighters, quietly deployed troops and an armored column which defeated the stunned criminal forces in short order. The battle, previously thought to be a particularly hazardous prospect, was won with no losses of UEE personnel and the resulting capture of information would lead directly to the destruction of two pirate outposts and a small capital ship.\n\nWith the recent reintroduction of the Tumbril Nova Tank, the Navy’s fleet of Hercules Starlifters has become busier than ever. However, delivering ground combat vehicles is far from the Hercules’ only task during the ongoing war against the Vanduul. With roads destroyed during the course of attacks, the Hercules Starlifter was a vital part in rescue operations on Urial, rapidly flying in earthmovers and cranes to assist in saving countless lives that would have otherwise perished in the rubble. Logistic vehicles like the Hercules are crucial in the Navy’s ability to respond to the shifting needs of the Empire. \n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_kraken_desc=The Kraken has been released and that means one thing, there’s no putting it back. This attack carrier has changed the way militias operate forever and, when it comes to personal defense, there’s one thing you never want to be - falling behind.\n\nA protector and a beacon of freedom in an often-cruel universe, Drake Interplanetary has made this capital-class ship available to all those tasked with safekeeping those unable to protect themselves. The Kraken is both a sanctuary and a self-contained war machine ready to take on the most daunting adversaries.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_mercury_desc=Good intel is the key to victory. That’s why the UEE Navy is seeking to increase the presence of the Crusader Industries Mercury Star Runner in its fleet this year. Already battle proven on several classified missions, the Mercury has delivered key strategic updates to our forces along the front, including Admiral Bishop himself, that have been the key to multiple hard-earned victories. Especially in “red systems” where comm networks may be non-existent, the Mercury’s ability to carry classified encrypted information has been a boon time and again.\n\nAdditionally, thanks to Crusader’s inclusion of a programmable kill switch and optimized security configurations, there is a significantly reduced chance of highly classified information falling into enemy hands. Pair that with the Mercury’s speed, precision, and cutting-edge countermeasures, it becomes easy to see why Navy Intelligence Officers have come to rely on this star runner for ensuring that information is delivered on time and intact. \n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_nautilus_desc=First introduced nearly four centuries ago, Aegis Dynamics’ Nautilus has made an indelible mark upon the Navy’s long and proud history, but it is just as needed today as when it was introduced during the First Tevarin War. The Nautilus has played a crucial role in the ongoing Vanduul War, using its minelaying capabilities to set up perimeter defenses and define the shape of the conflict.  \n\nOne such example is the mission known as the ‘Hellkite Run’ that was part of Operation Mandrake in the Oberon system. Flown by sapper specialists Squadron 761, aka the Alley Vipers, Nautilus minelayers were used to severely limit the Vanduul escape options. Working tirelessly while the main fleet engaged with enemy forces, they were able to deploy pockets of mines and weapon platforms with such precision that an entire Vanduul squadron was eliminated before they could escape the system to cause additional harm.\n
fleetweek2950_holoviewer_nautilus_title=Aegis Dynamics Nautilus
fleetweek2950_holoviewer_nova_desc=First utilized in the Second Tevarin War, the Nova tank has made a triumphant return to battle in 2948 thanks to efforts of the recently reformed manufacturer Tumbril. Military Historians still recount the original Nova’s performance at the 2605 Battle of Koren Pass where three Nova tanks held off an entire Tevarin strike team for over sixteen hours. While much credit is due to the brave soldiers who fought so valiantly, it is hard to deny that the Nova’s resilience and ferocity allowed for the UEE to prevail that day.\n\nThough they are most commonly found in the Army’s arsenal, you’ll find that Nova tanks are playing a pivotal role in the Navy’s combat operations, protecting tactical encampments across the Vanduul front. Its mobility means that it can quickly and effectively redeploy to provide combat support where needed and its resistance to extreme temperatures mean that the Nova can be posted in any number of environments. Knowing they’re protected by the Nova’s battery of arms allows pilots and starmen to work more effectively and creates a safer Empire.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_polaris_desc=One of the newest capital ships serving in the fleet, the Polaris-class corvette entered service in 2946 and has already made a big impact on the Empire. Thanks to the vessel's well-balanced mix of power and speed, it has enhanced the Navy’s overall effectiveness in a wide variety of scenarios, from delivering Humanitarian aid to tactical operations.  \n\nUnder the command of Captain Lucia Franco, the UEES Polaris has shown how essential the corvette’s adaptability is to the ongoing war effort. Recently of note, the Polaris and her crew were on extended patrol in Tayac when they successfully halted an attempted incursion by a Vanduul scouting party, potentially deterring further enemy action in that sector for the foreseeable future. Cpt. Franco attributed the vessel’s above-average quality of life standards to the combat effectiveness of her starmen.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_redeemer_desc=There are few ships that are awaiting deployment as eagerly as the Aegis Dynamics Redeemer. After being featured at two previous Invictus Launch Weeks, the Navy is closer than ever to utilizing the full potential of this cutting-edge gunship. The UEEN has worked closely with Aegis to perfect the Redeemer during this time to ensure that it will meet and exceed all the operational needs of such an advanced vessel. From the early reports arriving from various test squadrons, including the famous 999, the Redeemer is going to be worth the wait. \n\nDesigned to carry significant cargo and troops, the Redeemer will provide support in a variety of combat situations and logistical operations. The state-of-the-art technology employed by Aegis should make the craft one of the easiest to maintain to operational-effective standards. Additionally, the boarding hatch will permit faster transitions in situ while the VectorLock thruster design will allow for optimal maneuvering via its twin nacelles. High Command is eager to see what the Redeemer can do once it finds its way into the hands of enthusiastic pilots across the Naval fleet.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_taurus_desc=Invictus Launch Week celebrates the Navy’s best and brightest, but no celebration would be complete without mention of the hardworking crews aboard the UEE Merchant Navy fleet. These civilian-owned vessels are a vital part of the military supply chain and work tirelessly to ensure that those serving along the frontlines have the provisions they need. For years, the Merchant Navy has relied upon the RSI Constellation Taurus to successfully complete those dangerous runs through hostile territory.\n\nWith a streamlined chassis that can handle more cargo than any other Constellation variant, the Taurus allows each run to be maximized for efficiency. However, it still provides security above many similar freighters thanks to its utilization of defensive technology developed by RSI for its more military focused ships. One Merchant Navy Taurus, the Aliwent, is a particularly welcome sight for the brave starmen serving at listening posts in Kellog, delivering supplies and much needed care packages. It’s no wonder that many captains are eagerly waiting for the 2951 Taurus to be brought into service.\n

When your fleet of Drake ships is done laying waste to the latest batch of outlaws who were foolhardy enough to tangle with you and your people, there’s going to be no shortage of wreckage to wade through. \n\nThat’s where the Vulture comes in. No need to leave behind a veritable junkyard around your station or homestead for criminals to use as cover next time they attack; the Vulture can help you clean it all up and then some. Forget just clearing the way, salvage pays. What better way to defend yourself than to have the broken ships of your enemies pay for your next round of ammunition? Sounds like a fitting end to us.\n

hdactivist_assassination_danger_001=Don't take this target lightly. There's a reason Hurston's relied on them to do so much dirty work. 
hdactivist_assassination_danger_002=You're going after one vicious bastard, so best come prepared. 
hdactivist_assassination_danger_003=I'd recommend hitting them hard and fast before they have a chance to comm for backup. 
hdactivist_assassination_danger_004=Watch out for this one. 'Mercy' isn't part of their vocabulary. 
hdactivist_assassination_desc_001=To anyone who knows Hurston's recent history, they know that ~mission(TargetName) is responsible for some truly vicious crimes against the honest men and women who are trying to improve worker conditions on Hurston. Time and time again, they have acted well outside the bounds of UEE law but, of course, Hurston denies that ~mission(TargetName|Last) has anything to do with these crimes and refuses to even investigate them. This miscarriage of justice means that we must take matters into our own hands. \n\nRecently, an insider sympathetic to our cause says ~mission(TargetName|Last) can be found around ~mission(Location|Address). I will happily pass along this information, and a substantial payday, to anyone willing to bring vengeance upon them. ~mission(Danger)~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_assassination_desc_002=Any chance you've heard of ~mission(TargetName)? Hurston recently promoted this bloodthirsty thug to a special task force that makes dissidents disappear. ~mission(TargetName|Last) has proven to be quite effective and even taken a perverse pleasure in the new position. It's obvious that the universe would be better off if ~mission(TargetName|Last) was taken down.\n\n~mission(Danger)I managed to get a hold of their latest deployment orders. You should be able to find them at ~mission(Location|Address).\n\n~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_assassination_desc_003=Let's just say the less you know about this one the better. We want you to find and eliminate a Hurston lackey named ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(Danger) \n\nDetails containing their last known sighting around ~mission(Location|Address) will be provided. ~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_assassination_timed_001=Word spreads fast around here. Don't wait too long on this, or you might lose the element of surprise. 
hdactivist_assassination_timed_002=For the sake of the movement, it's vital this gets done soon. 
hdactivist_assassination_timed_003=There's chatter that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is planning something big. You've got to stop them before it's too late. 
hdactivist_assassination_timed_004=We need you to move fast on this. Who knows what the target is working on.

hdactivist_assassination_title_003=Retribution
hdactivist_basesweep_danger_001=They aren't expecting you, but don't think for a second this is going to be easy. Those bastards love to fight. 
hdactivist_basesweep_danger_002=Make sure you have more than enough ammo. There's no way to know how many of 'em will be down there. 
hdactivist_basesweep_danger_003=Make sure you're armed up and prepared for war. 
hdactivist_basesweep_danger_004=I'm not gonna lie, this will get bloody, but that's what we have to do to secure our future. 
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_001=Recently, Hurston security forces have been increasingly more violent to anyone voicing opposition to their authority. We've tried all legal channels, but it seems that an equally aggressive response will be the only way they'll hear us. I'm looking to pay someone to deliver that message.\n\nWe've learned that security forces have been operating out of ~mission(Location|Address). I'll send you the coordinates. You go in and clear it out. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweepDanger)\n\nHopefully there will be a day where we can resolve this through rational discourse, but they've made it clear that it is not today.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_002=Looking for a heavy hitter interested in some serious action. ~mission(Location|Address) is crawling with corrupt, armed assholes working for Hurston. I need them gone, pronto. Don't care how you handle it, only that it gets done. ~mission(Contractor|Danger) \n\nDo this right and you'll be compensated accordingly.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_003=If you found this, it's probably safe to say that you have an axe to grind with Hurston. I don't know about you, but I'm sick and tired of waiting for things to magically get better. What we need are bold actions to show Hurston that the status quo must go. \n\nThat's why I dug up some info about ~mission(Location|Address). It's where corporate thugs hang out and plan their attacks on the people of Hurston. Clearing that location would send a bold message to Corporate that we're willing to fight fire with fire. You interested? \n\nIt'll be dangerous, but you'll be paid well. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweepDanger) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_004=We got intel on ~mission(Location|Address) that says it's staffed with corporate thugs. We aren't just going to sit around and wait for them to crack down on our brothers and sisters who are just trying to make Hurston a better place to live. I don't have the skills to handle this type of op, but I've got the creds to fund it. Interested? \n\nShould go without saying, but this job will be highly dangerous. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweep)A lot of good people will get hurt if someone doesn't stop them.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_005=Looking for someone who's willing to fight for what's right. For far too long Hurston has used violence to keep its people in line. Now it's time to show them that their intimidation tactics won't go unanswered.\n\nI've recently obtained intel that's identified ~mission(Location|Address) as being key to their security operations. Anyone willing to clear out the location will be doing the people of Hurston a great service. It'll be risky, but I'll also make sure you're paid well for your trouble. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweep) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **

hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_001=One of the smugglers we work with on occasion, ~mission(TargetName), refuses to complete our arranged delivery unless we triple our agreed-upon payment. As you can imagine, we can't allow their greed to endanger the movement, nor can we afford to pay their unreasonable demands. \n\nInstead, we're hopeful that you'll be able to track them down for us and forcefully retrieve our rightful property. Once you successfully bring the shipment to ~mission(Destination|Address), we will gladly give you the credits we had originally promised ~mission(TargetName|Last). \n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_002=Recently, one of our much needed supply runs got hit by an outlaw. Before our hauler died, they managed to confirm the identity of their attacker - ~mission(TargetName).\n\nWe need you to hunt this bastard down and take back what's ours. And of course we'll pay you for delivering the supplies to ~mission(Destination|Address).\n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_003=~mission(TargetName) betrayed us. \n\nAn important shipment we had smuggled in to ~mission(Destination|Address) went missing a few days ago and we were finally able to track it down. One of our operatives, ~mission(TargetName|Last), had stolen it.\n\nWe need that traitor tacked down and the shipment brought back. Do whatever you need to.  \n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_004=Hurston Security is taking active action to cut off our supply routes. They're even turning a blind eye to outlaws in the area as long as it's our ships being attacked. We need to respond before our resources are completely cut off. \n\nWe've been able to track down the location of one of these outlaws, ~mission(TargetName). Bring the stolen goods aboard their ship back to ~mission(Destination|Address). I don't expect ~mission(TargetName|Last) will give it up without a fight.\n\nHopefully this'll show Hurston that we will not back down.\n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **

hdactivist_stealitem_danger_001=Things could get dangerous. Gear up just in case. 
hdactivist_stealitem_danger_002=Watch yourself out there. Pretty sure Hurston will do whatever it takes to keep us from getting this thing. 
hdactivist_stealitem_danger_003=Fair warning, but security might be at the site. If they come after you, do what's necessary to get that crate. 
hdactivist_stealitem_danger_004=As always, a gig like this can be dangerous. So plan for the worst, hope for the best, right? 
hdactivist_stealitem_danger_005=Be careful. Security could be all over that location. 
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_001=Got information on the location of a certain package that would greatly help our cause. We're looking for someone willing to hit up ~mission(Location|Address), retrieve the item, and deliver it to ~mission(Destination|Address). Interested? \n\n~mission(Contractor|Timed)~mission(Contractor|Danger)\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_002=Want to support a good cause and earn some solid creds? \n\nIf so, then help us get our hands on specific crate that's supposed to be in ~mission(Location|Address). If you find the crate and bring it to ~mission(Destination|Address), I'll make it worth your while. ~mission(Contractor|Danger) \n\n~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_003=There's a growing movement focused on making Hurston a better place and we need some help. We've been tracking a certain item for some time that could help our cause in multiple ways. With Hurston's recent escalation of oppression, we believe now is the time to acquire it for ourselves, but with security forces watching our every move, we need someone else to collect it from ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nIf you bring the crate to ~mission(Destination|Address), we'll pay you a price commensurate with your troubles. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)~mission(Contractor|Timed)  \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_004=Recently, Hurston fabricated charges against a hauler working for us in order to confiscate a very important delivery. Their actions aren't legal, even by Hurston standards, but they don't care and we can't wait attain it through legal channels. That's why I'm looking to pay someone to do it for us.\n\nAn insider who's sympathetic to our cause claims it ended up in ~mission(Location|Address). I'll send you the exact coordinates. ~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\nOnce you have the crate, bring it to ~mission(Destination|Address) and I'll transfer the creds. ~mission(Contractor|Danger) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_005=The Lorville customs office claims to have lost a crate that was being sent to us by a prominent supporter outside the system. I've got it on good authority that's a lie. Those Hurston bastards simply seized it to mess with us. I can't let this injustice stand and hope you're willing to help right this wrong.\n\nI just got word that they moved the crate to ~mission(Location|Address). I need someone to find this thing and bring it to ~mission(Destination|Address). ~mission(Contractor|Timed)~mission(Contractor|Danger)I'll make sure you're paid well for all your trouble.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_006=I need your help. An old friend was desperate for work, so I threw him a gig hauling a valuable item for us. Turns out he had an active crime stat, and Hurston Security arrested him before he could make the delivery. Now I'm in hot water. That crate needs to get to ~mission(Destination|Address) or I'm screwed.\n\nI pulled a few strings and discovered that the cargo actually ended up in ~mission(Location|Address). I'll pay you if you can retrieve it for me and make the delivery. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum**
