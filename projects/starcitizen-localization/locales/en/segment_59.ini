mg_miles_planetcollect_steal_desc_0003=Pretty simple. Grab ~mission(item) from ~mission(location) and drop off at ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)~mission(rush) Do that without getting pinched, losing the ~mission(item) or getting dead and we all get paid.

mg_pacheco_DestroyEvidence_desc_001=It turns out that security over at ~mission(location|address) got their hands on a box of evidence that shouldn’t exist. I’m gonna pay you to destroy it for me.\n\nGetting to the evidence won’t be a walk in the park. You’ll have to make it past the station’s heavy security, and then take out the Chief of Security in order to get their access code to the Evidence Storage Unit. And even that’s not straightforward since the Chief only deals with high-level emergencies so I’m thinking you’ll have to shoot up the place pretty good before they feel it’s worth showing up. Bringing a crew with you is probably a good idea.\n\nOnce the Evidence Inventory System is started up, the box I want should be easy to find - it's blue and has "EVIDENCE" written on it. Destroy that and I’ll get you paid.\n\nWhat you do after that is up to you.

It wouldn't be a bad idea to bring a crew along to help.\n\nOn the bright side, the evidence I want should be easy to spot. The box is blue and says "EVIDENCE" on the side. Anything else you want to take from storage and sell is fine with me as long as you remember that I’m your priority. \n\nOnce you have my evidence, drop it off at ~mission(destination|address) and we can call it a day.\n\n-Twitch\n

The station is thick with security and the only access code to the Evidence Storage Unit is kept by the Chief of Security. To make things worse, that snotty bastard doesn’t like to get their hands dirty unless it’s a full-blown emergency which means that you’ll have to escalate things before the Chief will even bother coming round.\n\nOnce you do activate the Evidence Inventory System, the box I want should be the first one out. Now, there might be more boxes coming out after it, you can consider those your bonus payment. \n\nJust be sure that you take care of dropping off my evidence at ~mission(destination|address) first and foremost.\n\n-Twitch\n

mg_pacheco_prisonerbreak_desc_001=Here’s the deal - A couple of long timers got snagged pulling a job for me and I want you to spring them. \n\nA friendly mechanic has arranged for their prison transport to run into some trouble en route, venting the front door and bringing the ship to a halt. You’re gonna go, dispatch any security escorting the transport, find the prisoner manifest aboard, and use it to locate my crew’s cryopods.\n\nThe popsicles I’m after are ~mission(NameSave1), ~mission(NameSave2), ~mission(NameSave3), and ~mission(NameKill1). All have been loyal and deserve better than rotting in jail.\n\nAt least I think they've been loyal... I'm still wondering how they got pinched in the first place. I can't shake the feeling that one of them may have been doubling dealing. Tell you what, if you find any proof that one of my crew has been working with the Advocacy, liquidate their cryopod and I’ll see you get a bonus.    \n\nOnce you've activated the right pods and my people are starting to thaw, get the hell out of there and let my team handle the rest. This last bit is important. See, once they’re defrosted, they're gonna be sent off to retirement. No sense in them knowing any more about my business than they already do, i.e. I don’t want these lunks seeing your face or even knowing you exist. \n\nOnce you’re back on your way, I’ll send you a hefty pile of creds.\n\nNow just in case you’re getting any ideas along the lines of “Why don’t I just free everyone?” or “Wouldn’t it be easier to shut them all up permanently?” Forget it. The politics of this whole thing is more complicated than you need to know. Just understand that if any extra prisoners get freed or die without me ordering it, you’ll be the one who pays. Want all your money? Do what you’re told and that’s it. \n\n-Twitch

mg_pacheco_prisonerbreak_title_001=The Price of Freedom
mg_pacheco_stealstash__desc_0001=Word is that security are gonna hit a stash house known as ~mission(Location) that some scabbers are using to store a treasure trove of narcotics. Among their supply, they've managed to snag a particular package of Maze. Seems like they're trying to up their station in the world.\n\nPrice of Maze on the street is skyrocketing... which is weird. Stuff just looks like wood chips to me. Anyway, I've gotten word that BlacJac's been tipped off to this little operation, so let's just say, this presents us with a unique opportunity. I know when the raid's going to start, so I want you to hit the stash before they show up and bring the Maze back. \n\nYou'll need a ship that can haul at least one box, but feel free to use something bigger. Anything else in the facility is up for grabs if you want to bother lifting it. Just be sure to deliver our Maze to ~mission(Destination) and we'll be square. Copy? \n\nIf you run into any resistance, I'll trust you'll deal with it, but the Maze is the real prize here.\n\n-Twitch
mg_pacheco_stealstash__desc_0002=Some of our competition over at ~mission(Location) is about to run into massive load of bad luck. BlacJac's caught wind of their stash house and are posting up to raid it.\n\nI've managed to find out exactly when they're going to hit the stash house, but I want you to hit it first. I imagine that the crew that's operating the stash won't be too enthusiastic about you robbing their supply, so if you run into any opposition, handle it.\n\nI want you to go in and steal their supply of Maze before security destroys it. Like I said, there's a bunch of drugs in there, but lucky for you Maze just looks like pieces of tree bark which should make it stand out. If you bring a ship that can hold enough cargo, you're welcome to help yourself to any of the other drugs in there. \n\nJust make sure that you can at least haul out the one box of Maze we're paying you for over to ~mission(Destination).\n\n-Twitch
mg_pacheco_stealstash__desc_0003=There's this little corner of heaven called ~mission(Location) that some of the local scumbags use to hand off drug shipments. You ever hear of it? \n\nWell, as of a few hours ago, a source told me that they were moving a package of Maze through there. I'm not sure if you've ever danced with that stuff before, but it looks like bits of bark.\n\nMy employers want it, but for whatever reason, they aren't willing to declare open war on this group. Apparently they're protected by somebody. Anyway, I tipped off BlacJac about the stash and they're getting ready to raid it. \n\nI want you to go in and secure the Maze before the place gets burned. Odds are this stash is gonna be guarded, so make sure you break some weapons. If you want to help yourself to anything else in there, that's on you to bring a ship big enough to haul it out. But at the very least bring a ship that can handle carting off the one box of Maze that's ours to ~mission(Destination). \n\nDon't worry about clearing out scavs you find there, either. Unless they get in your way that is. Thankfully, BlacJac'll get blamed for whatever body count gets left behind.\n\n-Twitch

mg_ruto_RetrieveConsignment_desc_001=Oh hello, I recently overheard a little bit of intel that ~mission(location|address) received some confidential materials that are of great interest to an acquaintance of mine. So interesting that they’re willing to pay for someone to storm the facility, grab the goods, and deliver them to ~mission(dropoff|address). Now I expect there to be plenty of security, who will most likely put up a fight, so I’d bring a gun or two. \n\nWord is the confidential materials were delivered in a consignment alongside other stuff and are now being stored in the facility’s automated vault. Senior security officers on-site carry datapads containing retrieval codes used to access the vault. You’ll have to get your hands on a datapad before using the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. \n\nIf you need a little sweetener, I’ve seen the manifest and can confirm that the other crates being stored at the facility are pretty choice. My client could care less about what happens to them, so they’re yours to do as you please. Run this right and those extra crates could be a nice bonus on top of the delivery fee for you.
mg_ruto_RetrieveConsignment_title_001=get the goods
mg_ruto_UGF_destroy_E_desc_001=Seems there’s a new upstart in the sector who hasn’t been paying the right dues to the right people. To teach them a little lesson, my client wants you to go down to ~mission(Location|Address) and destroy all the drugs on site.\n\nThe low-level lugs they got on site will probably make a stink about it and try to stop you.

mg_ruto_UGF_destroy_H_desc_001=A client of mine‘s trying to negotiate a deal, but isn’t having much luck. The other party feels like they got all the leverage because they’re sitting comfortably on a pile of inventory. To help move the negotiations along, I’m gonna need you to head down to ~mission(Location|Address) and destroy all the drugs on site. \n\nNow, I should probably tell you that the site’s being protected by some very serious people, so getting to the stash is going to be a bit tricky, but I trust you’ll find a way. \n
mg_ruto_UGF_destroy_H_title_001=inventory clear out
mg_ruto_UGF_destroy_desc_001=One of my clients has been unhappy to learn that someone's been muscling in on their territory. Now rather than going down the more traditional route of killing some people and starting a whole thing, they’ve opted to send a different kind of message instead.\n\nYou’re gonna go down to ~mission(Location|Address) and destroy all the drugs on site. \n\nOf course, if someone does wanna pick a fight with you, feel free to defend yourself, but getting rid of the product is the most important thing.\n

They’re hoping to be able to start production again almost immediately and don’t want to bother with hiring new staff. Got that? Kill goons with guns, don’t kill workers.\n
mg_ruto_UGF_eliminateall_allies_title_001=hostile takeover
mg_ruto_UGF_eliminateall_civsonly_desc_001=A client is getting out produced by a new competitor and is looking to throw a wrench into the works.\n\nYou’re going to head to ~mission(Location|Address) and kill all the civies who work there. \n\nDo what you want with the gun-toting goons guarding the workers, but remember that they aren’t the priority.  \n
mg_ruto_UGF_eliminateall_civsonly_title_001=too many cooks
mg_ruto_UGF_eliminateall_desc_001=This is a bit aggressive for my taste, but credits are credits, right?\n\nGot a client who's looking for a highly motivated individual to head over to ~mission(Location|Address) and kill everyone who’s there. \n\nBasically, start shooting and don’t stop. You'll get paid once the site's clear.\n
mg_ruto_UGF_eliminateall_nocivs_desc_001=I know someone who’s looking to start up a new business, but they’re having a hard time hiring the skilled workers they need.\n\nNow the thing is, they found the perfect crew over at ~mission(Location|Address), but the people they work for won’t let them go. Even hired extra armed guards to make sure of it.\n\nWhat I want you to do, is go there and kill all the guards while making sure all the workers remain unharmed. \n

mg_ruto_assassin_danger_0001=And from what I've been hearing, this scav's dangerous. If you wanna stay healthy, be smart about how you handle this one.

mg_ruto_assassin_danger_0003=And so you know, you won't be the first person who's gone after ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst). People think that they're a little bulletproof. Might take a few shots to keep 'em down.

mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0003=~mission(TargetName) is a ghost. Problem is, no one's told them they're dead yet.

mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0004=A piece of trash that goes by the name of ~mission(TargetName) just surfaced at ~mission(Location). Need you to put them down. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger) Last piece of advice - don't try to talk to them first or anything weird. Just do the job.
mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0005=Long story short, ~mission(TargetName) screwed over the ~mission(Client) and as it turns out, it's going to be the last thing they ever do. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger) A friend of the ~mission(Client) spotted them near ~mission(Location) so I'd suggest starting there. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) You find them, you put them down. Make it messy, make it clean. They didn't specify and I don't care. Just see that it's done right.
mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0006=The ~mission(Client) put out a hit on some local that's been stirring up trouble and you're going to execute it.

mg_ruto_clearcrimestat_norep_desc_01=Hi there. We haven’t had a chance to work together yet but I’m in a bit of a bind here and I could use another body. Not for nothing, of course. I’m all for a good quid pro quo.\n\nOne of my associates who was serving some time in Klescher was supposed to bring me a datachip, but then they went quiet. Now I’m assuming they’re dead, but here’s the deal: if you finish his job, I wipe your crimestat. Not bad, right?\n\nYour predecessor was apparently planning on using some old tunnels to make his escape. He made it sound like they weren't exactly the easiest thing to access, but I trust you can figure it out. I'm guessing you'll find his body somewhere in there and if we’re lucky, he'll still have the chip on him.\n\nOnce you get it, finish getting out however you can. Then get the data to me. There’s a spot nearby you can upload the chip’s contents. You might want to watch out for Hurston Security, though. They've been a hassle lately, so I wouldn't be surprised if you ran into them. After I get the data and validate it, I’ll wipe your crimestat. \n\nThen you can go and enjoy your newfound freedom. If you do this right, maybe I’ll have more lucrative work for you down the line.

mg_ruto_clearcrimestat_rep_desc_01=Hey there. I heard you ended up in Klescher which is a real drag. But it might actually be a lucky day for both of us.\n\nLong story short, I had somebody sneaking a datachip out of the prison, but they never got back to me. I know for a fact they haven’t left the facility, so I think something might have happened to them. While tragic, business must carry on. If you can get the chip and finish the job, I can clear your crimestat for you. What do you say?\n\nOf course, I don't know exactly how far they got, but I can tell you that the prison's got a whole network of hidden tunnels my guy was planning on using to make his escape. My guess is his corpse is rotting away somewhere there.\n\nOnce you find the body, I’m hoping the chip will still be on him. When you’ve got it, finish escaping and get the data to me. There’s a spot nearby you can upload the chip’s contents. \n\nOne warning though, you might want to watch out for Hurston Security. They've been a hassle lately, so I wouldn't be surprised if you ran into them.\n\nWhen I've got the data I’ll wipe your crimestat and then, voila, you’ll be free and clear. What you do after that is entirely up to you.

mg_ruto_collect_reclaimer_desc=Hey there. \n\nNine Tails got themselves a little problem. As it turns out, they got a little side biz in the underground organ trade. Now that an area I generally like to steer well clear of, but a gig’s a gig, right? It seems that one of their mobile butcher shops aboard the 'October Rising' got pinched by private security while out chopping. Now the Nine Tails are willing to cut ties with the ship and its crew (who are probably all dead anyway), but they need a particular crate extracted. Guess it was a special order or something.\n\nAnyway, get aboard the October Rising, get the package, and get out.\n\nSecurity’s still hanging around so watch yourself and maybe bring some friends, but remember, your priority is the package. If you're looking to save yourself some extra hassle, you could also black out the area by shutting down the nearest comm array if you want to avoid the crimestats for, you know, killing a bunch of a security. But hey, you do you.\n\nOnce you’re out, drop the package off at the clinic on Grim HEX and I’ll sort your payment.\n\nEasy peasy,\n\nRuto

mg_ruto_commhack_danger_0001=You might run into some trouble out there. I trust you know how to handle that. 
mg_ruto_commhack_danger_0002=I'm not gonna lie. You may have to fight some people on this one. 
mg_ruto_commhack_danger_0003=Oh, one more thing. You might have to kill some people to pull this off. 
mg_ruto_commhack_danger_0004=Hope you're up for a scrap. This job's set to get nasty. 
mg_ruto_commhack_desc=~mission(desc)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0001=Some ~mission(gang) are looking to get CommArray ~mission(CommArray) taken offline. ~mission(rush)Don't care how it's done. Just needs to get done. Sort it out for them and you'll get a nice bonus. ~mission(threat) ~mission(time)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0002=Look, no one likes being monitored while they work, right? So all we're going to do is take down Array ~mission(CommArray) for a little while while some people do some work. ~mission(rush)We don't need to get into who's doing what or any of the other details, the important thing is that once it's offline, some credits are going to find their way into your account courtesy of some ~mission(gang). ~mission(Time)Sounds good, right? ~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0003=I just got paid to manufacture a blackout. Which means that you can get paid for executing one. It's fairly simple, head over to CommArray ~mission(CommArray) and shut it down. ~mission(time)~mission(rush)~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0004=I was contacted by some ~mission(gang) to provide a little privacy. Guess they have a job or something going down. Anyway, that's not for you. You are going to bring down CommArray ~mission(CommArray). ~mission(time)~mission(rush)Take it down and I'll pay you out. ~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0005=So it seems somebody wants to make an area less secure. Shocking, right? As a struggling businessman in these tough economic times, I am uncomfortable with such a request, but I feel obligated to my clients. Customer service is very important to me. Anyway, you'll need to gain entry to CommArray ~mission(CommArray) and shut it down. Just an FYI, the ~mission(gang) who are putting up the creds for this are VIP, so make sure it's done right. ~mission(rush)~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_obj_long_01=Go to CommArray ~mission(CommArray).

mg_ruto_commhack_rush_0003=Don't mess around. This has got to get done now. 
mg_ruto_commhack_rush_0004=You need to move quick on this one. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0001=One more thing though, you're gonna need to make sure it stays off for a while. The pros need time to work, if you get me. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0002=When it's done, I'm gonna need you to babysit the array. Make sure no do-gooders come and switch it back on. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0003=Here's the deal. Once the array's down, make sure it stays down. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0004=You'll need to stick around once the hack's done. I need that blackout sustained for a bit.

mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0002=And arm up. You're heading to a crime scene, you know. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0003=Keep an eye on your scans. There might be some unfriendly sorts out there. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0004=This might go without saying, you are hunting down a corpse after all, but there might be a bit of violence out on this job. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc=~mission(Desc)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0001=A bit of backstory on this one. Some random scav has been going around claiming that they offed a big time hitter by the name of ~mission(TargetName). Claims that they caught ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) right in the middle of pulling a job. Now the thing is, if ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) is really dead... well... that creates complications for the ~mission(Client). \n\nAnyway, after some careful negotiations from yours truly, they've coughed up some creds to pay for someone to go out and verify that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is actually dead. ~mission(Timed)You will just need to go to ~mission(Location), find the body and confirm. ~mission(Danger) 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0002=Here's a bit of dreadful business to throw your way. ~mission(Client) had a recent op that apparently turned into a total shitshow. Mayhem and carnage to the nth degree. Anyway, the rumor was that ~mission(TargetName) got clipped in the exchange, but now people are saying that the bastard's still alive. \n\nAnyway, the ~mission(Client) need to know one way or the other. That's why I'm having you go out to ~mission(Location) and confirm that they're a corpsicle. Once you get the ID, you get paid. ~mission(Danger)Pretty simple, right? ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0003=Everyone's been talking about ~mission(TargetName) recently. The ~mission(Client) have been saying that they were killed a few days ago in the middle of pulling a job for them, but... well, let's just say that they're a less than accurate source of information. Anyway, I've got a client who's eager to prove them wrong, so they're shelling out some creds to get a positive id on the body. I'll hook you up with the  ~mission(Location). You have a look and tell me if you find them. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0004=Got a simple, but kinda disgusting job here. In a recent raid, ~mission(TargetName)'s ticket got punched and I guess the ~mission(Client) want some proof of old ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst)'s remains for... something. I honestly don't know why. Maybe they're worried that the bastard is playing dead just to steal from them. Anyway, they gave me the  ~mission(Location) and are paying for someone to go out and confirm the kill. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0005=The ~mission(Client) hired a hitter to take out a rival who's been poaching on their turf, but between you and me, I guess they didn't really get their credits worth because the guy forgot to provide proof that ~mission(TargetName) was actually dead. Anyway, I told them I could provide that, and by that, I mean you could provide it. All you gotta do is go to  ~mission(Location) and confirm that ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst)'s touching void. ~mission(Danger)Once I get confirmation, you get paid. ~mission(Timed)

mg_ruto_confirmkill_timed_0002=Another thing, the clients would like to know now, so get to it. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_timed_0003=I don't really know how long bodies stick around for, so I'd recommend getting a move on. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_timed_0004=You might want to move fast. God knows what's happening to that body right now.

mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0001=Odds are, anyone you come across won't be too pleased to see you. I trust you'll be able to handle them. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0002=I'm not anticipating this to be a smooth run though, so I'd make sure your guns are working. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0003=I'm not gonna lie. This one might get a little rough. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0004=Just gonna say, the last couple people I've sent on these runs have gotten tuned up, so stay sharpish. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0005=Might wanna get ready for a fight too. You never know. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc=~mission(Desc)
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0001=This one's gonna be a little tricky. The ~mission(Client) need someone to set up a ~mission(Item) so they can eavesdrop on the local suckers. You have to pick up the ~mission(Item) from ~mission(Location), set the thing up at ~mission(Destination) and get out. ~mission(Danger)Once it's up and running, you'll get your creds.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0002=Need someone to set up a snooping device for the ~mission(Client) and they're gonna pay well to make it happen. First you'll need to pick up a ~mission(Item). I think they got one set aside over at ~mission(Location). Anyway, whenever you've got one, make your way over to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Danger)You gotta set it up at the right spot or it won't work. Once the thing's running, get the hell out of there. Creds will be waiting when you're clear.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0003=~mission(Client) are paying for someone to drop a ~mission(Item) over at ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Danger)Pick up the ~mission(Item) from ~mission(Location) and get to it.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0004=You ever work with a ~mission(Item)? It's fairly simple stuff. Take it to an area, turn the thing on, and it taps into nearby comms. Nice little system if you're looking to dig up a little intel, maybe scout out a couple marks to hit. Anyway, I need one dropped at ~mission(Destination) for this thing I'm looking into and I need you to set it up. ~mission(Danger)Head over to ~mission(Location) and pick it up, they got one set aside for you. I'll transfer the credits once you got it active.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0005=I guess the ~mission(Client) are cooking up something big. They've requested a ~mission(Item) get set up over at ~mission(Destination). You'll need to grab one from ~mission(Location), head over and set it up. They're pretty self-explanatory, so don't sweat the set up. ~mission(Danger)\n\nAnyway, once you got the ~mission(Item) in place and active, get the hell out of there. I'll pay you after.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0006=Got client who's looking to put some ears on ~mission(Destination). All you gotta do is head over to ~mission(Location), pick up a ~mission(Item) then go set it up. ~mission(Danger)Job ain't over until the ~mission(Item)'s up and running, so make sure it's safe and operational. Once they get the data stream, you get the creds. Simple, right?
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(Location).
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_obj_long_02=Collect the ~mission(Item).

mg_ruto_distraction_analogy_003=By the time you're done, I want your name to be a warning. 
mg_ruto_distraction_desc=~mission(description)
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0001=I have to say, this might be one of the best plans I've ever come up with. See, the ~mission(client) are looking to pull off the job of the century, but no way they'd get away clean. That is of course, unless there's something even bigger going down at the same time. You're gonna be the something bigger. I'm talking chaos on a whole new scale. \n\n~mission(wanted)With that nasty of a reputation, all you have to do is go visit a ~mission(Location) in the area and shoot at everything that shows up. I'll even tip off the authorities so they know exactly where you are. I figure with all the noise you'll be making, no way anyone gives two shits about what the ~mission(client) are up to.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0002=This is the sort of job most scavers only dream about getting paid for. How often do you get paid to make as big of a mess as you can?\n\n~mission(wanted)Between the bounty on your head, and me telling everyone where to find you, you should have about every ship in the sector on your ass in seconds. I figure we'll have you make your stand at a ~mission(Location) and I'll make sure word gets out on where to find you. Then all you have to do is keep them occupied for as long as you can. \n\nOf course, you're probably wondering why you're doing all this. While I can't tell you the details, let's just say that the ~mission(client) are going to be very appreciative for you keeping all the security forces occupied.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0003=The ~mission(client) are gonna pay you to unleash as much hell as you can in the sector. ~mission(wanted)You show up at a ~mission(Location) guns blazing, I put the word out on the spec, and just like that, everybody is looking the other way while the real job is going down. Classic misdirection.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0004=You know how I normally want my people to keep a low profile? Well, not this time. The ~mission(client) need you to tie up every bit of law in the sector. Make them so busy they won't notice anything else going on. I'm talking next level destruction. ~mission(analogy)~mission(wanted)\n\nEven better is I'll tip off everyone before hand so they know exactly where to find you. I'm thinking a ~mission(Location) since those are usually patrolled to begin with. Then all that's left is for you to take down as many of the bastards as you can. Should make headlines on the spec for weeks.

mg_ruto_distraction_title_0004=all eyes on you
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_001=To make sure that they're paying attention, you're gonna have to get yourself to crimestat 5 and stay there. Only way to guarantee that every security hack and bounty hunter in the sector is gonna be making eyes at you. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_002=Here's the real fun part. In order to pull this off, I need you to get a level 5 crimestat. Hack a comm array, kill a bunch of people. I don't really care how. Just get to level 5 and stay there. That way there's no chance they're gonna be able to ignore a dangerous criminal such as yourself. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_003=Now, the reason I wanted you for this job specifically is cause of your crimestat level. Only a level 5 like yourself is a big enough threat to pull the kind of heat I'm talking about. Just do me a favor and make sure you stay at a 5 till this is all over. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_004=Plus, with your crimestat at a 5, you're the ideal candidate to pull this job off. Everyone within the system will be beating each other senseless to get a crack at taking you down. It's perfect. As long as you stay a level 5 that is. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_005=In order for this to work, you're gonna need to have a crimestat 5. That's the only way to make sure every security hack and bounty hunter in the sector is gonna be making eyes at you. Now, as it happens, I'm plugged directly into the system's ECN, so once you take the gig, I'll make you notorious.
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_006=The catch is you gotta instantly become the system's most wanted to get the kinda heat we want all focused on you. Fortunately, I got myself a backdoor into your criminal files to make that happen. All you gotta do is say yes and your crimestat goes through the roof, then you just focus on raising some hell out there.

mg_ruto_havejob_title_0008=got something for you
mg_ruto_intromission_desc=~mission(Description)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0001=Hi there. I've been hearing your name pop up a lot recently on security channels. Seems you're pretty hell bent on making life difficult for those authority types. I'll be honest. I like that kind of initiative. I know some people who might be interested in subsidizing your anti-social habits. But I'm getting ahead of myself. \n\nI'd like to see how you operate in the field myself, so here's the deal, the ~mission(Client) have pushed someone into the sweet hereafter and have paid for someone to make the remains disappear. That's considerate, right? No sense letting trash like that stink up ~mission(Location01). Anyway, I'd like you to go there, collect the boxes and dispose of them. Don't really care where as long as it's off-world and not in front of some cops. Simple, right? Anyway, you do this and we can talk about further, more lucrative, employment opportunities. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0002=You're becoming quite popular among the unsavories. My name's Ruto. You've probably heard of me. I'm a sort of talent scout for unsavories myself and I'm pretty good at it, if I say so. Part of the reason for that is standards. Not a lot of people have 'em. Me, I need to know that when I give a job to one of my people, that they'll execute it. Otherwise, it's just chaos, you know? But the bad kind. \n\nAnyway, I think we might be able to help each other out. First though, I need to see you in action for myself. The ~mission(Client) ghosted some idiot down at ~mission(Location01) and need the packaged up remains disposed of. Feels like something you could handle, no? Knock this out and maybe we can talk more. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0003=Why hello. Been watching you for a while now. Not in a creepy way or anything, more like professional curiosity. See, I make it my business to know who's making moves in my system. If I see someone with potential, let's just say, I bring them into the fold. \n\nAnyway, I think you might be the kinda person I should know better. But first, I've got a little job for you. Something simple to show me that you're not one of these lazy kids I see on the spectrum. That you're a real go-getter. \n\nThere's remains of a body down at ~mission(Location01). I won't tell you who did it or why. Only that the boxes need to get gone. Take them off-world somewhere and dump it. You do that and maybe I can fill you in on all the exciting opportunities available to an entrepreneurial go-getter like yourself. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(location)
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_long_02=Collect the body.

mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0001=Need to take care of this quick though. Sorry. Hate to rush, but you know, clients are paying.
mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0002=Oh, I'll need you to sort this out on the quicker side.
mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0003=One more thing, you'll need to hurry. Clients want this handled now.
mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0004=Yeah, probably should mention that I need this taken care of immediately, so off you go.

mg_ruto_invite_desc=~mission(description)
mg_ruto_invite_desc_0001=You handled yourself pretty well. I suppose it's time we meet up and make this official. Sound good? I'm working out of this old tech shop on Grim HEX called Technotic. Just come on in and find me in the back. ~mission(oldman) Anyway, swing by when you can.
mg_ruto_invite_desc_0002=Thanks for taking care of that little job for me. Hope it wasn't too messy. Anyway, as promised, I'd like to invite you down and see if we can't work out a little arrangement. If you're interested, head on over to Grim HEX. Somewhere in the back halls, you'll find a run down little hole called Technotic. I'm in the back. ~mission(oldman)
mg_ruto_invite_desc_0003=I think it's about time we talked about your future. Don't you think? You ever been to Grim HEX before? Nasty little corner of nothing in the field above Yela. Swing on by and look for a tech shop called Technotic. I'm in the back. ~mission(oldman) Anyway, we'll have a little chat about your future, yeah? See if we can help each other out.
mg_ruto_invite_obj_long_01=Meet with Ruto in Grim HEX
mg_ruto_invite_obj_marker_01=Ruto
mg_ruto_invite_obj_short_01=Meet with Ruto
mg_ruto_invite_oldman_001=Don't mind the guy at the front. He's kinda like a watch dog. Just older... and quieter.
mg_ruto_invite_oldman_002=Whatever you do. Don't piss off the guy at the front. He may not look like much, but he's an ex-Marine.
mg_ruto_invite_oldman_003=Word of warning, the guy I have guarding the counter is violent. Real violent. If you see him wearing green, run. That's his trigger color.
mg_ruto_invite_oldman_004=Make sure the guy in the front doesn't talk your ear off.
mg_ruto_invite_oldman_005=Don't worry about the antique at the front counter. He came with the place.

mg_ruto_outpost_repair_DIY_0001=my dad trying to fix the air recycler
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_DIY_0002=my old roommate trying to make his own quantum fuel
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_DIY_0003=the time this banger I ran with rigged his gun to be autofire and nearly destroyed his ship
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_DIY_0004=this old miner who figured she could build herself a better EVA suit.
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0001=The longer they're dark, the more credits we lose. Need them up and running ASAP. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0002=A lot of people are waiting on them to be up and running again, so basically, hurry the hell up with this. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0003=A lot of credits run through the place which makes this repair pretty damn urgent. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0004=Some other jobs I got cooking are waiting on this being taken care of and I don't like being kept waiting. Faster you get this done the better. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0005=Not to rush you or anything, but this needs to get taken care of fast. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc=~mission(Desc)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0001=Normally people in our rarified profession don't mind working in the shadows, but having zero power is a bit much. It's even starting to hurt the operations down over at ~mission(Destination). See if you can go sort them out with a new battery, okay? ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0002=A storm down surface side a little while back caused some damage and now ~mission(Destination) doesn't have any power at all. Can't really afford to have them down for long, so I need you to bring them a replacement battery. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0003=Some wingnut over at ~mission(Destination) tried fixing an electrical problem on their own and now the whole outpost doesn't have power. Got to love that DIY attitude. I'm having flashbacks to ~mission(DIY). ~mission(Timed)Anyway, do me a favor and run a battery down there.
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0004=I'm hoping you have some maintenance experience, because I need someone to bring a replacement battery down to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)And if anyone's there when you show up, don't let them talk you into cleaning up or anything. The contract is just for the battery.
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0005=Got word from ~mission(Destination) that they've gone dark. Not sure what the hell they're doing there, but this is like the fifth time they've lost power this month. Probably trying to run a hot tub or something off the gennie. Either way, gonna need you to bring them a replacement battery. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_obj_long_01=Acquire replacement battery.
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_obj_long_02=Go to ~mission(Location).

mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc=~mission(Description)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0001=There was an 'accident' and now there's a couple of boxes of remains where they shouldn't be. ~mission(Client) need a cleaner to cart them off-world. ~mission(Timed)And don't tell me what you do with them. It's probably better if I don't know.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0002=The ~mission(Client) had a change of leadership and their former manager's been made redundant right through the eyes. Now they need someone to "clear out the desk," so to speak, and dump everything off-world. ~mission(Timed)Really makes me appreciate being self-employed.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0003=Bit of a going away party / funeral that I want you to attend. The guest of honor needs a ride off-world and you're gonna give it to 'em. Dead bastard really should have known better than to skim from the ~mission(Client). ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0004=Guess there was a bit of a disagreement between a couple of ~mission(Client) that got pretty heated. Anyway, they need someone to escort whatever's left of the losing side off the premises. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0005=One of the big truths in this 'verse is that dead bodies seldom go anywhere on their own. That's why the ~mission(Client) need us to move one for them. I'm sure you can figure out somewhere suitably private to take the remains. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(Location01|Address). 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_obj_long_02=Collect all boxes containing remains and remove them from the site.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0002=The ~mission(Client) are a little on edge about the remains just sitting out there. I've told them there's nothing to worry about, but let's go ahead and take care of this as fast as possible. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0003=We need to hurry up and take care of this before before someone starts poking around. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0004=Gonna call this a rush job. Remain are not going anywhere, but the ~mission(Client) will feel a lot better once everything's been taken care of. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0005=Don't take too long on this. Last thing we need is for someone else to get to the remains before you do.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0001=This is a simple delivery run. Pick up a box of ~mission(drug) from ~mission(location) and take it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0002=Short and sweet. You're gonna head to~mission(location) and pick up a shipment of ~mission(drug). Make sure you keep a low profile and run it to ~mission(destination)". Simple. ~mission(rush)~mission(threat)One more thing. This is for the ~mission(client), so don't screw it up.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0003=Word's come down that the ~mission(client) need some product moved from ~mission(location) and delivered to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)Hopefully I don't need to reiterate this, but don't even think about sampling the supply.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0004=Apparently there's been a high demand for ~mission(drug), so the ~mission(client) need to re-up their dealers. You're gonna head down to ~mission(location), pick up the package and take it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0005=Here you go. Like I said, it's a pretty straightforward job. ~mission(client) need some ~mission(drug) grabbed from ~mission(location) and taken to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)You do this right and not only will you stay in my good graces, you'll make some nice creds as well. Seems fair, right? ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_rush_0001=This job comes with a timetable, so I'm gonna need you to move quick on this. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_rush_0002=Hurry up too. I'm told the masses are eager for their party favors. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_rush_0003=You'll be on a clock with this one. The~mission(client) need their supply quick.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_trouble_0002=A little bird told me that there might be some heavies out gunning for this job too. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_trouble_0003=You might need to fight some people on this one. Just so you know. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_trouble_0004=Be ready for a scrap. I'm not expecting this one to go smoothly. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0001=Make sure you bring some guns. There's a high potentiality that this one might get a little rough. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0002=There's a good chance you might need to kill some people on this one. I trust you don't have a problem with that. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0003=And keep your eyes open. Word is there are predators circling, if you get my meaning. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0004=You don't mind killing people right? I'm not promising anything, but you might want to make sure you got some guns. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0005=Guy I know said that this job might've been shopped around before it landed with me, so there might be some unfriendly competition out there. Handle them. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc=~mission(desc)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0001=~mission(client) need a ~mission(item) transported from ~mission(location) and dropped at ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0002=You know how to move a box, right? This is right up your alley then. Pick up a ~mission(item) at ~mission(location) and run it over to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)Get it done right and the ~mission(client) cut you some creds. Simple. ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0003=We've been hired by the ~mission(client) to move some cargo. Now, they didn't tell me what's in the box and you're going to be paid not to care. All you gotta do is snag the ~mission(item) from ~mission(location) and get it to ~mission(destination) in one piece. ~mission(rush)~mission(threat) \n\nOh, do me a favor and don't look inside, okay? 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0004=As far as gigs go, they don't get much more basic than this. All you gotta do is go to ~mission(location) and snag a ~mission(item). Once you got it, take it over to ~mission(destination) and dump it. That's it. Seriously. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0005=This is a a straight cargo run. The ~mission(item) needs to get from ~mission(location) to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)This is a job for the ~mission(client), so don't screw it up.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0006=Got a simple run for you. Well... it should be pretty simple. ~mission(client) need a ~mission(item) moved from ~mission(location) to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(threat)Get the ~mission(item) there in one piece and you get paid.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_rush_0003=Hurry up on this one. There are people waiting. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_rush_0004=If you do this job, make sure you take care of it quick.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc=~mission(Description)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0001=Here's the deal. Some people I know have some ~mission(Item) that needs disposing of. I know. I know. Not exactly the type of work you dreamed of doing, but creds are creds, right? Times like these, people should be grateful for anything that comes their way. All you gotta do is pick up the ~mission(Item) and dump it off-world. Don't care where, but maybe not in front of some cops.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0002=Kind of a basic run. Not really worth your talents, but hey, a gig's a gig, right? All you gotta do is pick up some ~mission(Item) and get rid of it. That's it.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0003=Need you to swing by one of my clients and take away some ~mission(Item). They're paying to get it off-site and off-world, but don't care what happens after that, so neither do I. Do it and you'll get paid.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0004=Looks like a friend needs some ~mission(Item) disposed of without any questions. Head there, grab the ~mission(Item) and dump it off-world. They don't come much simpler.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0005=Hope you don't mind getting your hands dirty. I'm serious. This isn't a metaphor. There's some ~mission(Item) that needs to get dumped. Head on over and they should have it all boxed up and waiting for you to get off-world. One time contract. Standard pay.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0006=This here's a quick one. Shouldn't be too much trouble. There's some ~mission(Item) that needs to disappear. Pick it up, dump it off, get paid.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(Location01|Address).
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_obj_long_02=Collect all ~mission(Item).

mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_001=And I don't know if they've been doing some special training, or if they changed what they've been feeding the bastards, but some of these security pilots aren't half bad at fighting. Make sure you go in ready. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_002=Now, if this was a one on one, I'd put my credits on you hands down, but since these sec-jobs tend to travel in packs, clearing them out may end up being a pretty tough fight. Not trying to scare you off, just think you should know what you're in for. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_003=Be good to teach these corporate guns that standing up to the ~mission(client) doesn't pay. However hard they fight - and trust me, they're gonna fight - you fight back even harder. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_004=Of course, as much as we make fun of these security hacks, don't underestimate them. Any idiot with a gun can kill you if you get sloppy. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc=~mission(description)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0001=~mission(contractor) have gone ahead and started poking around somewhere they shouldn't. You're gonna make them stop. Head out to ~mission(location) and clear every last one of those advocacy-wannabes from along their patrol route. ~mission(danger)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0002=Seems ~mission(contractor) has started patrolling out over in ~mission(location) by some of the ~mission(client)' territory. They'd normally take care of it themselves but since they've got something bigger in the works that they'd rather not risk, decided to hire an outsider to sweep the area clear. ~mission(danger)Last thing, try not to let any of them escape. It's not really professional, you know?
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0003=The ~mission(client) have a score all lined up, but they can't do anything about because some over-achieving ~mission(contractor) lugs are patrolling ~mission(location). Need you to fly along the route and take out any security you find. ~mission(danger)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0004=I tried to warn them, but the ~mission(client) got overeager and now, thanks to them attacking too many civies, ~mission(contractor)'s stepping up patrols through ~mission(location). Gotten so bad they can't do business as long as security's there. That's where we come in. You're going to fly the patrol route and sweep it clean. ~mission(danger)Honestly though, I think you're gonna have a lot of fun with this one.
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0005=Despite the best efforts of myself and the other criminally-minded individuals in this sector, ~mission(contractor) is still trying to clean the place up. They even started patrolling out in ~mission(location). Can you believe it? There's no way we're gonna let that kind of initiative stand, so that's why you're going to fly along this patrol and clear them the hell out. ~mission(danger)

mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0002=Anyone messes with you, you drop them, yeah? 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0003=Another thing, this'll take you in some rough parts of space. I'd recommend guns. Lots of guns. 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0004=You know, looking at the ~mission(ship)'s position, I'm thinking you might wanna make sure your guns are all charged up. 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0005=One of my people told me the ~mission(client) might've shopped this job around, so you may run into some trouble. 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc=~mission(desc)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0001=A ~mission(ship) got punched out while on the drift. ~mission(client) are paying for someone to go out and pull a ~mission(item) from the wreck. ~mission(trouble)Once you get it, they want it dropped over at ~mission(destination).

mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0002=I'll keep this simple. I need you to extract a ~mission(item) from the corpse of a ~mission(ship) and leave it at ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)The ~mission(client) passed along the location of ~mission(location). ~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0003=~mission(client) are hiring. They want someone to head out to ~mission(location) and snag a ~mission(item) from the wreck. I don't know if they killed the ~mission(ship) and I don't really care. Once you got the ~mission(item), just take it over to ~mission(destination) and drop it off. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0004=This is that gig I was telling you about. Seems pretty casual, if you ask me, but I don't have to go out there. Anyway, ~mission(client) want someone to pull a ~mission(item) from a ~mission(ship) corpse and run it over to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)That's it. ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0005=I know how much love crawling around the wreckage of a ~mission(ship) so I saved this one just for you. And guess what, the ~mission(client) will even pay you for it. All you gotta do is snag a ~mission(item) while you're out there and take it to ~mission(destination). I'll send you the details on ~mission(location). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0006=I'm gonna include the exact job request from the ~mission(client) in its entirety just so you can see what I have to deal with:\n\nhy Ruta, my offaz an i went an downed a ~mission(ship) off in the black. bozz wanna boxes from it but didnt tell us. we three bottlz inna night and needin someone to go grab it. i sendin creds for it. \n\nI just don't know how some of these idiots stay alive as long as they do, much less fly a spaceship.

mg_ruto_spacesteal_danger_0003=Get ready for some violence, yeah? I don't think this'll go peacefully.

mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc=~mission(Contractor|StealDescription)
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0001=Here's the deal, got a tip from ~mission(Contractor|StealNickname) that some skag named ~mission(TargetName) got real ambitious and snagged a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) from some suckers. That's all well and good, but it seems that they owe some creds to the ~mission(client) and have been refusing to use their newfound wealth to settle up. Now, the ~mission(client) want someone to ghost 'em and retrieve the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) from the wreck. That way, they get their money back and remind any future idiots that they gotta pay their debts. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) Once you get the goods, drop them off at ~mission(destination) and get paid. ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger)
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0002=How do you feel about thieving from thieves? Shouldn't matter, right? The ~mission(client) are looking to hire someone to obtain ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) from some geezer's ship. Find them, hit them, grab the stuff and drop it at ~mission(destination). That'll be that. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger)
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0003=Here's that robbery I was telling you about. Need you to hit some poor bastard named ~mission(TargetName) who's made the massive mistake of acquiring some ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) that the ~mission(client) are looking to obtain. ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger) Once you got it, run it over to ~mission(destination) and I'll make sure your credits are waiting. After my cut, of course. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed)
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0004=How're your boosting skills these days? Job's fairly simple. Track down a ship owned by ~mission(TargetName), take it out and retrieve a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) from the wreckage. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Danger) Once you got it, all you gotta do is drop off the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) over at ~mission(destination). Pay's coming down from ~mission(client), so make sure you deliver.
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0005=~mission(client) are paying for someone to knock over ~mission(TargetName)'s ship and steal a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem). Contract's very specific that they got to go. No bargains, no mercy, just one to the dome and a trip to their cargo hold. Take the stuff to ~mission(destination) and get paid. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger)
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0006=Friend of mine said that ~mission(nickname) was posted up in Old38 wasted out of their mind, bragging about how ~mission(TargetName) had scored a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) that was, and I quote, 'valuable as hell.' Now, I floated this tidbit out to the sharks and the ~mission(client) were the most interested. They're willing to pay for you to head out, track down ~mission(TargetName|Last)'s ship and snatch the loot. Once you do, run it over to ~mission(destination) and drop it off. ~mission(client) will transfer the creds once they get it. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger) I think we've all learned a valuable lesson about the dangers of bragging, haven't we?

missionManager_BravoDefender_Description=Hello, we have learned of your continued efforts to increase public safety in our area and wanted to propose an exciting job opportunity.\n\nWe've suffered some construction issues on Security Post Kareah that have delayed its opening. Unfortunately, since it's connected to our criminal database, local thugs have been using it to erase their criminal records. I've gotten approval to contract independent operators as temporary security personnel to guard these terminals against unauthorized access. If you subdue any trespassers, we will provide additional compensation as hazard pay.\n\nIf you accept this position, we will provide you with the equipment to complete your job. Please understand that you will have to stay on-site for the duration of your shift. Should an emergency arise before your shift is over, you just need to resign your post at the security office before leaving. Unauthorized departure will be considered a breach of contract and result in criminal charges.\n\nSincerely,\nPauline Nesso, Facilities Manager\nSecurity Post Kareah, Crusader Industries

It's not exactly the easiest station to get into since Crusader Security started using it as an evidence lock up and there's officers crawling all over the place, but beggars can’t be choosers, right?\n\nJust grab a cryptokey (Technotics in Grim HEX might be able to set you up), sneak or fight your way into Kareah, hack the criminal database, and just like that, no more crimestat ratings.
