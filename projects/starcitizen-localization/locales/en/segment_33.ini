PU_NTGUIDE01_M_NTG_Announce_Tour_MessHall_IG_001_HelloEveryoneMy=Hello everyone, my name's Lt. Horrigan and as you can probably tell, this is the War Hammer's mess hall. Definitely one of the more popular spaces on the ship, the mess has a fully automated dispensary since we operate on rotating shifts. We have a standard crew complement of sixty-five to seventy and meals need to be available at all times, so we have a culinary team always on duty, ready to lend support. The famous pilot Aria Reilly was once quoted as saying "If you ever want to take the temperature of a ship's crew, spend twenty minutes in their mess." This is one of the main social areas of the ships where crew members from different departments can catch up in their downtime. We also use the mess for social events like birthdays, holidays, and promotions since it's able to hold so many people. Our skipper, Captain Medcalf, is a big believer in casual gatherings in an effort to entrench kamaraderie, so we're in here pretty often. Now you've probably noticed our games in the corner so I'll just address the question that everyone asks: yes, it's pretty competitive. The XO currently has the score to beat. Anyway, I'd like to invite you to have a look around.

PU_NTGUIDE02_M_NTG_Announce_Tour_Barracks_IG_001_HiFolksWelcome=Hi folks. Welcome to the War Hammer. I'm Leading Starman Detmer and this, as you've probably guessed, is one of the two barracks on the ship. I know, I know, you must be thrilled to see where Navy personnel sleep and let me be the first to tell you, it's every bit as exciting as promised. Javelins are pretty great when it comes to the sleeping arrangements as they have enough bunks for the full crew which is amazing because it avoids situations known as 'hot bunking' where you swap out bunks with somebody on the opposite shift. That, is horrible. This one time on my old ship I had to share with this guy who had just the worst smelling socks. I'm talking 'the military could've weaponized it' kind of bad. And I had to try and fall asleep with that stench every, day. So, after that, these bunks are a dream. Actually, I don't think my CO would like me talking about how bad hot bunking is. Maybe just forget I said anything.\n\nAnyway, each one has special slots for personal effects and is capable of sealing up to give you a little privacy as people are always moving around the barracks. Sleeping schedules shift slightly too and they can activate the full crew at a moment's notice if the ship enters heavy combat, so you're always sleeping with one eye open anyway. I mean, we get shorter sleep schedules if we're patrolling in dangerous space, so you're already grabbing sleep when you can. Sorry, I'm rambling. Otherwise... yeah, I'm not sure what else to tell you. This is where we sleep. Not a whole lot of mystery to it. \n\nI hope this has been enlightening. Have a look around if you want, but please don't touch anything in the bunks. This is an active ship and everything in here is the property of the crew, so be cool.
PU_NTGUIDE02_M_NTG_Close_Tour_Almost_IG_001_LooksLikeWere=Looks like we're wrapping up for the day. You should take off.

PU_NTGUIDE03_F_NTG_Announce_Tour_Turret_IG_001_AllRightLets=All right, let's settle down. My name's Lt. Commander Aldeman, I run the turret complement aboard the War Hammer. That means I'm in charge of coordinating fire between our various gunners during a combat engagement in order to maximize combat effectiveness. But, when we aren't in combat, I strive to keep my team sharp by running through engagement drills and simulated encounters. Now the Javelin comes standard with fifteen turrets, thirteen of which have embedded operators. There are six turrets like the one you see here that run along the side of the ship. Each of which is equipped with a pair of Size 7 cannons for larger targets and a pair of Size 4 gatlings for smaller targets like fighters and even incoming missiles and torpedoes. We've got four more turrets on the bow of the ship, armed with Size 7 energy cannons and three gunners on the underside with the same. All this firepower is coupled with a heavy payload of ordnance to make the War Hammer a real problem for all sizes of ship, hence why we can be tasked to operate independently on patrols without support from the rest of the battle group.\n\nDuring the XenoThreat incursion, our gunners were responsible for the destruction of over seventy hostile elements and several capital ships as well as protecting the ship from incoming ordnance.\n\nAs a special treat, we've safetied this turret so you can get a taste of what it feels like to be a gunner. All the weapons have been deactivated so don't worry about accidental discharge, but I'll remind you this is an active military vessel, so be respectful all the same. Thank you and have a great Invictus.
