Dlg_SC_mc_taking_fire_1006=Nothing motivates a pilot to go a little faster better than getting shot at.
Dlg_SC_mc_taking_fire_1007=Shields are lighting up as some serious damage is dealt.

Dlg_SC_mc_taking_fire_1009=Taking damage like this is not something any pilot can afford.
Dlg_SC_mc_taking_fire_1010=I can say from experience, when you're getting shot like that, the main thing running through your head is, "Please don't hit my thrusters."

DynamicEvent_FleetWeek2022_Description=*FOR IMMEDIATE SYSTEM-WIDE RELEASE*\n\nAttention, Nine Tails forces have seized control of several commercial platforms near Orison. Using an Identity Friend or Foe Inverter (IFFI), they have taken over the restricted air space surrounding the platforms and only Nine Tails affiliated ships can gain access to the area. This has severely hampered Crusader Security's initial attempts at retaking the platforms. As such, Crusader has requested that CDF forces assist in shutting down the inverter and eliminating all hostile presence. Any available CDF volunteers are encouraged to provide support.\n\nAdditional Intel:\n* While the inverter is active and the airspace inaccessible, CDF has managed to gain control of a local shuttle system and route it to access Solanki Platform without the Nine Tails knowledge. Volunteers will need to head to the Crusader Industries Showroom on the Commercial Platform and get to the rooftop to find the shuttle that will travel to the occupied platforms.\n* The IFFI is believed to be located in a locked storage container on a cargo barge docked at the central Admin Center.\n* Access codes for the IFFI container are in the possession of the leader of the Nine Tails forces, Mendo Ren. \n* Past experience with Mendo Ren indicates that he is unlikely to show his face and risk capture. However, if all his lieutenants are neutralized, we believe he will have no choice but to take command of the forces in person and provide us the opportunity to retrieve the codes from him.\n* In addition to the shuttle system, Crusader Security has informed us that there are several vehicles on the platforms available for CDF to commandeer. These vehicles will be the only way of reaching the Admin Center. NOTE - If all of the vehicles within the restricted air space are destroyed before the inverter can be shut down, then there will be no way of reaching the cargo barge and the CDF will be forced to retreat.\n* The platforms are protected by Nine Tails controlled Anti-Air weapons.\n\nPlease be aware that SAIC Rowena Dulli from the Advocacy is the official attaché to the CDF and will be running the operation.

Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_E_Desc_001=A price has been set on the heads of ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2). \n\nWhile having to hit two targets isn't that weird, the client wants to send a very specific message, so they need to targets hit at the exact same moment. The extra credits should make up for the hassle.\n\nAnd unfortunately since the pair aren't traveling together, it goes without saying that to pull it off you're gonna need some help. Make sure you bring people you trust can handle more than one ships since the targets are known to travel with backup. \n\n
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_E_Title_001=Double Tap
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_H_Desc_001=Contract's for two targets that need to be taken out at the same time. \n\nGuess the client is worried that if they aren't eliminated together, one of them will go dark and try to get some revenge.\n\nThey go by ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2).\n\nFind yourself a team, divide and conquer.\n\nAnd make sure whoever it is has got skills, because these two have a reputation for holding their own in a fight and they for sure won't be alone. Be ready for them to give you some trouble. 
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_H_Title_001=Two In The Head
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_Intro_Desc_001=Interesting assignment came my way. I need two separate targets taken out: ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) \n\nProblem is, either one gets word about the other being hit, they’ll go to ground. Can’t risk losing either of them. \n\nIt’ll take considerable coordination, but I want you to hit them both at the same exact time.  \n\nAnd since you can’t be in two places at once, you’ll need to find someone you can trust to help on this.\n\nThankfully, my intel says that both the targets should be traveling alone. That should help make things a bit easier on you.
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_Intro_Title_001=Coordinated Takedown
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_M_Desc_001=Got a contract to take out two up and comers who've been stirring up trouble. It has to be clean, both done at the same time, or else they might cause even more trouble.  Long story short, you'll need some help on this one.\n\nBoth ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) know how to handle themselves, and the people they fly with aren't no joke either. You can expect each of them to be guarded by a few ships.
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_M_Title_001=Double Elimination
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_S_Desc_001=Normally, the pair of ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) would be too much to take on together. They both are about as good as it gets when it comes to dogfighting and the crew they fly with are almost as good.\n\nBut recently they split - not sure why - and are flying separate for the moment.  Someone thinks this may be the best chance to take them out. \n\nGather some personnel you can trust and plan a simultaneous raid against both targets. It's too dangerous to risk one of them living after such a direct move against them.
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_S_Title_001=Divide and Conquer
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_VE_Desc_001=Have another pair that need to be eliminated:\n~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2)\n\nThey've been in the wind for a few days now, but just popped up. If we don't get them now, I'm not sure we will get another chance.  You need to enlist a partner to make sure both targets are hit at the same time.\n\nAs far as them putting up resistance, ~mission(TargetName) is known to bring along a friend to watch their back, and I suspect ~mission(TargetName2) will do likewise. 
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_VE_Title_001=One-Two Combo
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_VH_Desc_001=~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2).\n\nTwo serious operators who've recently decided to make a move against their boss. Each of the pair are traveling with a small, highly trained armada and cutting deep into territory that doesn't belong to them.\n\nYou, and whoever you recruit to help, are going to take them out and it has to be both at the same time so they can't regroup.

Ellis1=Ellis I
Ellis10=Bombora
Ellis10_Desc=The second gas giant in Ellis system, Ellis X features a consistently turbulent atmosphere. It was this chaotic nature that led to its local nickname of Bombora.
Ellis11=Ellis XI recently suffered a cataclysmic collision with one of its moons. Astrophysicists speculate that the planet will continue to splinter and ultimately form a new asteroid belt.
Ellis11_Desc=
Ellis12=Judecca
Ellis12_Desc=A ball of ice, Ellis XII (also known as Judecca) is occasionally used for ice-mining expeditions.
Ellis13=Pinecone\n
Ellis13_Desc=Though technically not a planet, Ellis XIII is considered a local mascot. This protoplanet's unique shape has given it the nickname Pinecone.
Ellis1_Desc=This protoplanet is a scorched, barren ball of rock and bubbling magma due to its extreme proximity to the star. While the possibility exists that there are major deposits of minerals on the planet, mining them would be far too risky.
Ellis2=Ellis II
Ellis2_Desc=Ellis II's large size, proximity to its sun, and surprisingly thick atmosphere has left its entire surface a massive desert, marked with strange swirls and ridges created by frequent massive storms on the planet's surface.
Ellis3=Green
Ellis3_Desc=The vast oceanic world is mostly known as the primary resort destination for racegoers who enjoy Green's high-end mega-resorts. In an effort to protect the elaborate underwater reefs, ships landing on the planet are directed towards specific landing zones.
Ellis4=Kampos
Ellis4_Desc=Named after the large sea creatures that once stalked its deep oceans, Kampos was the first world settled and continues to boast the highest population center in the system.
Ellis5=Noble
Ellis5_Desc=The emerald jewel of the system, Noble is known for the vast stretches of woodland, evoking many comparisons to an undeveloped Earth. The local Governors Council has made sustaining the planet's natural beauty a priority.
Ellis5a=Ellis 5a
Ellis5a_Desc=The regolith of this moon is slightly pink, making it a popular subject for lunar photography.
Ellis5b=Ellis 5b
Ellis5b_Desc=A tidally locked moon, the planet-facing side is pristine while the star-facing side is pocked with craters. 
Ellis6_Desc=A terrestrial planet located just outside the system's green band. Although the planet is technically uninhabited, Ellis VI has been used to conduct studies about human habitation.
Ellis7_Desc=A corrosive and poisonous atmosphere covers this planet making it impossible to terraform or even land on.
Ellis8_Desc=The smallest planet in the system, Ellis VIII boasts a micro atmosphere and little else.\n
Ellis9=Walleye
Ellis9_Desc=Nicknamed Walleye by long-distance haulers, Ellis IX is a swirling gas giant that intermittently suffers from massive storms visible from space.
Ellis_AsteroidBelt1=Ellis Belt Alpha
Ellis_AsteroidBelt1_Desc=Perhaps the best known asteroid belt in the UEE, the Ellis Belt became famous for being a Murray Cup racetrack. Over the years, the Murray Cup has sought to acquire all rights to the belt, making mining strictly prohibited.     \n
Ellis_Desc=This thirteen-planet system contains a wide habitable zone thanks to its F-type main sequence star. Ellis is mostly known as the home of the UEE's most famous race, the Murray Cup. What began as way to kill time during the terraforming process has become big business; fueling the economy for the three terraformed planets -- Green (Ellis III), Kampos (Ellis IV), and Noble (Ellis V). Ellis' eleventh planet recently collided with its moon, leaving an asteroid belt in the former orbital path.

FW22_NT_Datapad_Admin_MSG_06=Come on, man. You know I didn't mean you. Just worried about the download.
FW22_NT_Datapad_Admin_MSG_07=It's gonna go fine. Even if they find out what's going on, it'll be too late to do anything.
FW22_NT_Datapad_Admin_MSG_08=Yeah, especially since I got the system locked tight with a password generated from the first digit of all your codes.
FW22_NT_Datapad_Admin_MSG_09=Well, there you go. Pretty much the only way they'd be able to stop us is if they pull a Globy and guess the damn thing.

FleetWeek2950_Family_Body_01=Your loved one has just taken the first step towards a proud life in Naval service. You may have questions about what they will experience in basic training, the safety of your relative/friend, and what kind of contact you can expect during their training and subsequent deployment.\n\nWe know that this can be a scary time for some people and hope that this will offer some peace of mind about the wonderful opportunities that can result from this decision.\n
FleetWeek2950_Family_Body_02=Standard training begins as the recruits arrive on MacArthur via Naval transport. They are immediately given a choice, known as the Rubicon, which is a final opportunity to reconsider the enlistment. After which, the recruits will be divided into groups and assigned to their training camp, known as a Forge. They will also meet their Divisional Officer who will be their first mentor to train them for Naval Service.\n\nAfter an extended period of intense drilling, physical fitness, and education in military theory and technology, the recruits will transition into the Candidacy phase of their training. During this time, they will undergo a series of physical, psychological, and intellectual tests to determine where in the Navy they would be the best fit for. Some may move to the flight academy, some to research, a few may even be detailed for Marine training.\n\nFrom this point on, the recruit will receive dedicated training into whatever discipline they’ve been selected for. This will account for the remainder of their training and will end with their first ship assignment which will coincide with the next Invictus week unless there is a need for more specialized training. \nAfter that, they will deploy.\n
FleetWeek2950_Family_Body_03=We understand that the first few weeks away from the recruit are the most difficult for family and friends, but we ask that you refrain from attempting to contact them. \n\nTo help, all recruits will send a comm to let their family know that they’ve arrived on MacArthur safely, but as a common practice, we want to keep the recruits focused on these initial phases of their training as they can be crucial in their development. Therefore, we will restrict any inbound communications until after this blackout period ends. After that, you will be able to contact them on a more regular basis as comm access is a weekly privilege.\n
FleetWeek2950_Family_Body_04=A Starman’s deployment experience will vary based on their ship assignment and specialty. Many of these can take place far away from active combat zones or in dangerous areas of operations but some of these do end up placing them in harm’s way. You must understand that all of our service men and women will be trained to endure in these high intensity situations.\n\nThe Navy does offer several programs for friends and family who are having difficulty coping with a loved one on deployment, so feel free to contact the outreach department at your local Naval station to speak with a counselor who can walk you through the best options to put you at ease. \n
FleetWeek2950_Family_Body_05=While many of our personnel find that the Navy can offer a complete career, some are happy to take their experience and training back into the private sector as a Citizen. You’ll be pleased to know that honorable service in the Navy opens a variety of opportunities that may not have been available before such as continuing their education on one of the Empire’s many institutions or transforming their newfound skills into a high-paying career in the civilian world.\n\nRegardless of which path they choose, your loved one will be well-equipped to handle all the challenges that life throws at them, knowing that they have loving friends and family like yourselves, and a forever family in the Navy.\n

FleetWeek2950_History_Body_01=The UEE uses Invictus Launch Week as an opportunity to not only congratulate the latest graduating class of starmen and pilots, but also celebrate this newest group of recruits gathering to set off for training. All over the Empire, sons, daughters, partners, brothers, and sisters say goodbye to their loved ones before embarking to MacArthur to start their next journey in life: \n\nThe adventure of service in the UEE military.\n\nDuring this time, Naval vessels dock around the Empire and let the populace see these brave defenders and awe-inspiring ships up close. Invictus is also a wonderful opportunity for the community to come together with local governments, businesses, and law enforcement to talk about planetary security and outreach.\n
FleetWeek2950_History_Body_02=This may come as a surprise, but Invictus actually goes back several centuries to the days when the UEE was known as the United Planets of Earth (UPE). Shortly after the First Tevarin War began in 2541, Humanity suddenly found itself in need of an organized military force at a size previously unneeded. To this point, aside from the hostage situation with the Xi’an in 2530, there had only been local security forces under the control of the central Human government.\n\nWith Humanity facing an imminent and overwhelming threat, a fleet needed to be raised and trained quickly. The Tribunal sent out an immediate call for recruits to create this army.\n\nTransport ships on each of the settled planets would load up these volunteers and travel to a training facility on Mars known as Invictus. \n\nOn the morning of 2542-10-12, families and communities gathered at launch pads around the UPE territories to celebrate those that were going to defend against the alien invaders. As the conflict continued, more recruits would gather on that day to travel to Invictus to begin their training.\n\nOver the centuries, as the Empire has expanded, space travel has become even more accessible and most recruits are able to self-report, the need for Invictus Launch Week’s has diminished. The spirit of it, however, is stronger than ever.\n\nInvictus is a time to celebrate each other. To celebrate bravery, duty, and commitment to the goals that define Humanity at its finest.\n\nWelcome to Invictus.\n
FleetWeek2950_History_Title_01=WHAT IS INVICTUS LAUNCH WEEK?
FleetWeek2950_History_Title_02=WHEN DID INVICTUS START?
FleetWeek2950_Testimonial_Body_01="To me, it was never really a choice. I know a lot of people grapple with the decision, but honestly, it never crossed my mind. I mean, both my parents got their Citizenship from military service, so maybe that was a factor. There was a moment though when I touched down on the tarmac, I was suddenly seized with this fear that I wasn’t going to be able to make the cut. That was the scariest thing to me; being afraid that I was going to let down my parents and all the people who proudly wore the uniform before me. Thankfully, the Navy isn’t about me. My brothers and sisters built me up and made me the starman that I am today."
FleetWeek2950_Testimonial_Body_02="Growing up, I never really thought that I would be military. I was a rambunctious kid, to put it mildly. Wasn’t great with authority. To be honest, I was on a bad road and by all accounts probably would’ve stayed on it, until a Judge Advocate set me straight instead of sending me to jail. Once I was in, I managed to find the one thing that had been eluding me all my life: a family."
FleetWeek2950_Testimonial_Body_03=“I’m sure you’re talking to a lot of people who joined up wanting to be Aria Reilly or Cal Mason or something, but me? I wanted to learn. To me, all the wonder of the universe was found in nuts and bolts, in shaving fuel efficiency by three percent. That was my rush. If you want to get your hands on the latest in cutting edge technology and work with some of the greatest minds, the UEE Navy is the place to go.”
FleetWeek2950_Testimonial_Body_04=“I’ll just come right out and say it, the second after I signed up, it felt like I got hit by a ship because it was real now. Was I going to have to fight a Vanduul face-to-face? Hell, was I even going to make it through boot? I mean, I struggled to do a pull-up when I was a kid. What the hell was I thinking? Maybe I could try to get out of it. All these thoughts just ambushed me from that moment up to my Invictus. There was this Lieutenant monitoring all the recruits who must’ve seen how terrified I was. I was fumbling with the seat belt when suddenly the Lieutenant was right in front of me. All he said was “Calm down.” I don’t know. It was part consolation, mostly order, but whatever magic he used. It worked. I wasn’t totally calm when I hit my forge, but I found out everybody was freaking out too. That was our first bond.”
