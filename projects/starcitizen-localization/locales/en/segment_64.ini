shubin_claimsweep_desc_001=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nA recently acquired Shubin Interstellar mining claim awaiting processing was discovered to have been jumped by a rogue mining outfit who are actively stealing ore from the site.  While local authorities have been notified, there is concern that valuable assets may be harvested before an official investigation can be launched.\n\nTherefore, as is our right as claim holders, we wish to secure a mercenary force to go to ~mission(Location), destroy the orbital sentries that are protecting this illegal operation, and clear the site for Shubin repossession. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.
shubin_claimsweep_desc_002=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nA local Stanton independent mining team was working ~mission(Location) as Shubin Interstellar contractors when a hostile force attacked and took over the site. We believe that the perpetrators are still at the claim using the equipment left behind to harvest the valuable ore there for themselves.\n\nAmong the equipment lost were orbital sentries that had unfortunately not yet been fully deployed at the time of the attack. Long range scans of the claim have led us to conclude that the outlaws have activated the orbital sentries and are using them to protect their illegal operations.\n\nTo reclaim the site, we are seeking contractors to go to ~mission(Location), destroy the orbital sentries, and clear the site for Shubin repossession. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.
shubin_claimsweep_desc_easy=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nWe just received word that a Shubin contractor was chased off one of our claims by outlaws who are operating there illegally. Further complicating matters, they have set up a few orbital sentries to protect themselves while they mine. \n\nOur hope is to contract with a mercenary who can search for and destroy the sentries at ~mission(location). If you do encounter an illegal miner at the site, be mindful that it is common practice for these types to contact reinforcements for assistance. It might be better to neutralize them as quickly as possible before they can do so. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.\n

Efficiency is strongly recommended as there is a high risk they will call for reinforcements once they discover they’re being evicted. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.\n
shubin_claimsweep_desc_intro=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nIt was recently discovered that a Shubin mining claim has been illegally poached by a rogue miner. While the miner themselves seems to no longer be stealing ore from the site, they did leave behind an orbital sentry which is preventing us from reclaiming it thanks to its offensive capabilities.\n\nWe are looking for a mercenary willing to travel to ~mission(location) hunt down the sentry and destroy it in preparation for Shubin repossession of the site.\n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.\n
shubin_claimsweep_desc_med=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nA recently acquired Shubin Interstellar mining claim awaiting processing was discovered to have been jumped by a rogue mining outfit who are actively stealing ore from the site.  While local authorities have been notified, there is concern that valuable assets may be harvested before an official investigation can be launched.\n\nTherefore, as is our right as claim holders, we wish to secure a mercenary force to go to ~mission(Location) and destroy the several orbital sentries that are protecting this illegal operation. Caution is advised as there may still be a few illegal miners at the location along with any reinforcements they muster. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor.

shubin_claimsweep_desc_rand=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nWhile conducting a survey of Shubin claims in the sector, we were disheartened to learn that a small team of outlaws have set up shop at ~mission(Location) and have been illegal harvesting resources. Worse, they have established a defensive perimeter with several orbital sentries dotted around the site making it difficult for us to evict them. \n\nIn order that we may repossess the claim site, we are seeking mercenary contractors to find and destroy the handful of orbital sentries. Adding additional difficulty to the task is that we are unclear as to the exact fighting strength of these outlaw miners. If they are given the chance to summon reinforcements expect anything from a small contingency to a full squad of trained fighters. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.\n

spacesteal_danger_0004=Not sure if the ship's gonna have escorts or not, so be ready for anything. 
spacesteal_danger_0005=I don't expect ~mission(TargetName|Last) to give you much trouble. They usually fly solo and if they do drag along friends, it's not much.   
spacesteal_danger_0006=I'm thinking grabbing the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) should be pretty straightforward since they usually fly by themselves. But even if they do dig up an escort, it's gonna be dreg pilots at best. Nothing you should worry about, really.  
spacesteal_danger_0007=From what I remember, ~mission(TargetName|Last) usually flies this little multicrew dragbox. Shouldn't be too much trouble, but it might get tricky if they've got friends along. 
spacesteal_danger_0008=I expect that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is going to be flying what they normally do - a small multicrew thing. The real issue will be if they decide to bring any of their friends along to fly escorts. 
spacesteal_danger_0009=Word of warning. It might take a bit of doing to get the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) since they'll be flying a pretty hefty freighter and most likely the bastards will be bringing escorts along. Cost of doing business, I suppose. 
spacesteal_danger_0010=Be mindful that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is going to be carting the goods in a pretty sizeable ship. Plus, they usually spring for extra security on top of that. Not gonna lie, it won't be easy, but the haul should be worth it.

spacesteal_desc_0002=Need someone to do a bit of aggressive acquisition for the ~mission(Contractor|Name). They got their heart set on a certain ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) and guess what? It's going to be sitting pretty aboard some hap's ship. All you got to do is pay this ~mission(TargetName) a visit, grab the goods, and fly 'em over to ~mission(destination). ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Danger)That's it. The credits are basically yours already.
spacesteal_desc_0003=Heard a few whispers that a ship's pushing off with some precious cargo aboard, but thanks to me and you, it's not going to stay that way for long. You're gonna find where ~mission(TargetName)'s ship is flying and relieve it of its burden. ~mission(Danger) Once you got it, drop the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) off at ~mission(destination) and the ~mission(Contractor|Name) will see that you're compensated for your efforts. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed)
spacesteal_desc_0004=Payday! The ~mission(Contractor|Name) want a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) that ~mission(TargetName) has aboard their ship and it's up to you to get it for them. Let me tell you, you're going to make some sweet, sweet creds if you're the one to bring it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Danger) One last thing. I shouldn't even have to say this, but if you so much as think about keeping the goods for yourself, understand that you won't live long enough to enjoy it.
spacesteal_desc_0005=Attention - If your name is ~mission(TargetName), go ahead and save yourself a world of hurt and just bring the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) to ~mission(destination). If you're not that sap, then I'd like to present a business opportunity. How would you like to make some credits by chasing down ~mission(TargetName|Last) and taking the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) from them? ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Danger)
spacesteal_desc_0006=Not sure if you remember this, but a little while back ~mission(Contractor|StealNickname) boosted this amazing haul but then immediately lost it like a giant idiot. Well, everyone and their grandmother has been looking for it, but yours truly actually found it. The ~mission(Contractor|StealItem)'s aboard the ship of someone named ~mission(TargetName). Now I never heard of them, but whoever they are they're going to regret every stumbling upon that stash. The ~mission(Contractor|Name) will pay us a finder's fee if we can grab it and take it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Danger) Get it done and we'll both be legends.
