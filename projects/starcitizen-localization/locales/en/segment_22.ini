All of the Nine Tails command have been dealt with and we just need to find their inverter to restore control of the Restricted Airspace back to Crusader. Get down there and get it done. If you need any more details, check your mobi.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_BossDead_RepeatOccur_IG_002_ItsLookingLike=It's looking like we're very close to getting control of the Restricted Airpsace. The Nine Tails commander and lieutenants are all neutralized. Now we just need to find and disable their inverter on the cargo barge to stop their reinforcements and allow our ships access again. Your mobi has been updated with all the details.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_BossDead_RepeatOccur_IG_003_HeresAQuick=Here's a quick brief. The Nine Tails Commander and Lieutenants have been dealt with. We're just searching the barge for that inverter to restore command of the Restricted Airspace to Crusader. Any questions, check your mobiGlas for a full breakdown.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_001_AllRightWelcome=All right, welcome to the operation. Here's the situation. A short while ago, Nine Tails outlaws infiltrated and attacked these commercial platforms. Your primary goal is to return control of the Restricted Airspace to Crusader, that way we can grant our ships access and block Nine Tails from bringing reinforcements to the platforms. \n\nWe know that the Nine Tails are using an Identity Friend or Foe Inverter to control vehicle permissions, so that's your target. We think it's being stored somewhere on the central cargo barge in a locked storage container. Unfortunately, the Nine Tail in charge of this mess has been identified as Mendo Ren, a longtime member tied to dozens of robberies and murders. \n\nBased on his M.O., we know he'll keep a low profile until we eliminate the other Senior Level Nine Tails. So travel to each of the platforms, neutralize the Nine Tail Lieutenant there, then engage Mendo once he comes out of hiding to get his access codes and shut down the inverter. Right now, the platform you're heading towards is Solanki Platform, it's some kind of commercial residencey for visiting VIPs. You might find a few small ships stored there. Crusader's given us permission to commandeer them. You're going to need them to reach the cargo barge when it's time as the platform's shuttle system doesn't directly connect to it. I'll provide updates as you progress. Good luck.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_002_NowThatYoure=Now that you're here, I wanted to get you up to speed on the operation. You're approaching a small network of platforms that Crusader uses for VIP Sales. Nine Tails outlaws have seized control of the air and platforms and we need to take them back. Your first objective will be to return control of the Restricted Airspace back to Crusader. The Nine Tails are using a device called an Identity Friend or Foe Inverter so they can bring in reinforcements while our own ships are locked out. \n\nWe know that the device is being hidden in a locked storage container somewhere on the cargo barge docked at central platform. It seems however that the only person with the container's access codes is Mendo Ren, a veteran Nine Tails outlaw, who is in charge of this attack. Having dealt with him before, we believe that he will stay hidden until he is forced to get involved. This means that to get to Ren, you will first have to neutralize the Nine Tails lieutenants he's assigned to each of the platforms. Once you take them out, you can get the codes from Ren, and shut down the inverter. \n\nThe platform you're headed to now is Solanki Platform. I'm told Crusader uses it to house VIPs that are visiting Orison. There should be a few small ships here that we have permission to use. Comandeering vehicles will be vital to us reaching the central platform as it is disconnected from the shuttle system. I'll make sure to update you if anything changes. With your help, I have faith the CDF is going to come out on top today.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_003_BeforeYouArrive=Before you arrive at the platform, let me give you a high level brief of the situation. Members of the Nine Tails outlaw pack seized control of five platforms outside Orison. Our biggest concern at the moment and your main objective will be regaining control of the Restricted Airspace. The Nine Tails have smuggled an Identity Friend or Foe Inverter into that area which is keeping all our ships out and letting theirs in. \n\nWe need to get the Inverter shut down as soon as possible, but doing so is going to be a bit tricky. The device is being stored in the cargo barge docked at the central platform, and the only one with the codes to access it is the Nine Tails commander, Mendo Ren. Now, from the intel we gathered, Ren will stay out of sight unless necessary. That means we will need to remove the Nine Tails Lieutenants from the platforms to draw him out. Once we take him down, we can get the codes from him and take the inverter offline.  \n\nCurrently you are headed towards Solanki platform, which is used by Crusader to host visiting VIPs. Thankfully, there are several small craft stored there that we'll be able use to move between platforms. We're going to need them to reach the central platform and the cargo barge when the time comes since the shuttle system doesn't connect there, so don't waste the ships. That should be all the info you need for now. I'll check back in soon. The full mission details and current status will be updated in your mobiGlas. Stay focused, watch yourself, and let's get this done.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_MiniBossesDead_FirstOccur_IG_001_AllRightWelcome=All right, welcome to the operation. Your mobi should have the latest updates but here's a quick rundown. Nine Tails outlaws seized control of these commercial platforms and have been causing chaos. Your primary goal is to return control of the Restricted Airspace to Crusader, that way we can grant our ships access and stop Nine Tails reinforcements from reaching the platforms. We know that the Nine Tails are using an Indentity Friend or Foe Inverter or IFFI to control vehicle permissions so that's your target. It's being stored somewhere on the central cargo barge in a locked storage container. Unfortunately, the only one with the access codes is the Nine Tail in charge of this mess, Mendo Ren. \n\nFinding him and getting the codes is your first task. Once you have them we can finally shut down the inverter. Right now, the platform you're heading towards is Solanki Platform, it's some kind of commercial residencey for visiting VIPs. You might find a few small ships stored there that Crusader's given us permission to commandeer. You're going to need them to reach the cargo barge when it's time as the the platform's shuttle system doesn't connect to it, so use them wisely. I'll check in with any updates as you progress. Good luck.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_MiniBossesDead_FirstOccur_IG_002_NowThatYoure=Now that you're here, I wanted to get you up to speed on the operation. You can always check your mobi for the latest details, but our first objective will be to return control of the Restricted Airspace back to Crusader. Currently the Nine Tails are using an Identity Friend or Foe Inverter to make it so they can bring in reinforcements while our own ships are locked out. We know that the device is being hidden in a locked storage container somewhere on the cargo barge docked at central platform. It seems however that the only person with the container's access codes is Mendo Ren, a veteran Nine Tails outlaw who's in charge of this attack. I want you to focus on finding him and getting those codes so we can shut down the inverter. \n\nThe platform you're headed to now is Solanki Platform. Crusader uses it to house VIPs visiting Orison. There should be a few small ships here that we have permission to use. Comandeering vehicles will be vital to us reaching the central platform as it is disconnected from the shuttle system.

For full details on the mission, everything should be up to date in your mobiGlas. Our biggest concern at the moment is regaining control of the Restricted Airspace. The Nine Tails have smuggled in an Identity Friend or Foe Inverter that's granting their ships access while blocking ours. This is allowing them to bring in their reinforcements to the platforms. We need to get the Inverter shut down as soon as possible, but doing so is going to be a bit tricky. \n\nThe device is being stored in the cargo barge docked at the central platform, but the only one with the codes to access it is the Nine Tails commander, Mendo Ren. I want you focused on tracking down Ren and getting the codes off of him. \n\nCurrently, you are headed towards Solanki platform, which is used by Crusader to host visiting VIPs.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZInactive_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_001_AllRightWelcome=All right, welcome to the operation. Your mobi should have the latest updates but here's a quick rundown. We have managed to return control of the Restricted Airspace to Crusader, but there's still plenty of work to do. All remaining Nine Tails forces and anti-air defenses under their control need to be dealt with before we can fully regain the platforms. \n\nRight now, you're heading towards Solanki Platform, it's some kind of commercial residency for visiting VIPs. If you don't want to use your own vehicle, you might find a few small ships stored there that Crusader's given us permission to commandeer. You could also use the platform's shuttle system to get around if need be. I leave it up to you. I'll check in with any further updates as you progress. Good luck.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZInactive_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_002_NowThatYoure=Now that you're here, I wanted to get you up to speed on the operation, but you can always check your mobi for the latest details.

Crusader uses it when the have VIPs visiting Orison. You're welcome to use your own ship, but if not, there should be a few small ships here that we have permission to use. I'll make sure to update you if anything changes. With your help, I have faith the CDF is going to come out on top today.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_Siege_ExpNeg_IG_001_ListenImAfraid=Listen, I'm afraid that with the way things currently stand, the CDF doesn't want your help on this mission.

Don't have much time for pleasantries though, so I'll get right to it. They docked the Javelin here to resupply it, but XenoThreat are now targeting our supply ships to stop that from happening.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_StationArea_Resupply_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_FirstOccur_IG_003_YouveMadeIt=You've made it to INS Jericho. The station's the supply depot for the operation against XenoThreat.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Station_HospNotSet_Siege_IG_001_HeyBeforeYou=Hey, before you head out to the platforms, you might want to think about making an imprint at Orison General. If worse comes to worse and you need to regen, it'll make things a lot easier for you.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Station_HospNotSet_Siege_IG_002_WordOfWarning=Word of warning. These platforms are a warzone, so you probably want to have an imprint at Orison General if you haven't already. Save yourself a longer trip back.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Station_NFZInactive_Siege_IG_001_WithTheRestricted=With the Restricted Airspace back under our control, you can take your own ship instead of the shuttle if you prefer.

The Nine Tails are controlling the AA defenses using devices stashed inside the Pressley's Party Supply crates. The Lieutenants on each platform will have the codes to access the containers.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindContainer_FirstOccur_IG_003_GuessWhatTurns=Guess what? Turns out Pressley's Party Supplies doesn't exist anymore.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindIntel_FirstOccur_IG_001_WithTheLieutenant=With the lieutenant on this platform dealt with, it might be worthwhile to search their body and see if you can find any usable intel.

PU_BANISTER_MG_GenericChatter_IG_002_IKeepRunning=I keep running into these people who think stellar cartography is dull. Can you believe it? Cartography! I mean, if you think precisely scanning star systems and charting every single astronomical feature is dull, then I don't even know what to say to you.
PU_BANISTER_MG_GenericChatter_IG_003_HeresSomethingYou=Here's something you may find interesting - my surname, Banister, came from the fact that my ancestors like forty or so generations back were master stair craftsmen.

PU_BANISTER_MG_GenericChatter_IG_004_LetMeBounce=Let me bounce something off you. I'm debating going to either Cassel or to Green for my vacation and you know what, nevermind. I just decided. Tangaroa it is.

PU_BANISTER_MG_Greeting_GoAway_IG_002_IllBeHonest=I'll be honest, I'm not sure what you think you're doing here. I definitely can't trust you to help, and if I'm being upfront with you, I really don't want to chat with someone I can't trust. It'd be better if you just go.
PU_BANISTER_MG_Greeting_GoAway_IG_003_LookImNot=Look, I'm not saying it's going to be this way forever, but right now I think it'd be better for both of us if you stopped coming here. You go do your stuff. I'll do mine. And if anything changes, I'll let you know.

What these little guys see, I see. Which, yes, means I can totally see you. Right. Now... <pause> Anyway, there was actually a reason to why I\ncomm'd. I'm sorta not allowed to leave my post, important jump point scanning and all, so I was hoping you might be able to help me with something.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_FailStreak_IG_001_AnotherFailedRescue=Another failed rescue, huh? You haven't crossed a shaman or something, have you? Not that I believe in curses, but in the face of overwhelming evidence it might not hurt to re-evaluate that stance.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_FailStreak_IG_002_WeKeepTrying=We keep trying to help these people in these distress beacons, but what good is it when these outlaws are getting more and more ruthless. Maybe we have to accept that it's a lost cause.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Fail_IG_005_WantedToLet=Wanted to let you know that I appreciate you risking your life to help those people, even if it ended the way it did.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Ignored_IG_001_IWasA=I was a little surprised you decided not to help that last pilot. Guess I was silly for thinking you were the kind of person who cared about people in trouble.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Ignored_IG_002_ItWasTooBad=It was too bad you weren't able to make it to that last distress beacon in time. I'm thinking about sending the pilot's family a fruit basket. A nice one though, one that isn't all melon.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_SuccessStreak_IG_002_ImKindaBlown=I'm kinda blown away by the number of people you've helped out there. It's like you're some kind of insurance fairy, saving hulls before premiums can go up.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_SuccessTurnAround_IG_003_WantedToSay=Wanted to say nicely done on that last rescue. You heard someone needed help, you went and tried to help them, and in a surprise turn of events it actually worked. Hopefully this is the start of a trend.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Canceled_IG_001_GuessYouWerent=Guess you weren't able to finish that last job. Bit embarrassing, when you think about it. Saying you're going to do something, then changing your mind.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Canceled_IG_002_ImSuprisedYou=I'm surprised you canceled on that last job. Must be that modern work ethic my nan was always complaining about.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Canceled_IG_003_SawThatYou=Saw that you canceled the last job. That's too bad. I'm guessing you have your reasons but still... oh well.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Generic_Fail_IG_001_OhItWas=Oh It was too bad to hear that last job didn't work out. I feel sort of responsible since I was the one who set you up with it. Oh well, guess these things happen.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Generic_Fail_IG_002_SeemsLikeThings=Seems like things didn't go that smoothly on the last job. Live and learn as nan used to say. She also used to loved eating citrus. Always had an orange or a pomelo on her. I miss her a lot.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_FailStreak_IG_002_LostAnotherProbe=Lost another probe, huh? I guess what they say is true. More probes, more problems.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_FailStreak_IG_003_YoureReallyNot=You're really not having any luck with these probes. Like none. It's almost impressive.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Fail_IG_001_NoLuckOn=No luck on that last probe, huh? Eh...I guess we'll just have to make do without for now.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Fail_IG_002_ItsTooBad=It's too bad you're weren't able to deploy that last probe. It would have come in handy.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Fail_IG_003_IDidntThink=I didn't think deploying a probe would be that hard, but I guess it's just one of those things that depends on who's doing it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Fail_IG_004_LooksLikeYou=Looks like you ran into some trouble placing that probe. I will admit, I'm a bit disappointed. I was really hoping to see the data it would've provided.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Fail_IG_005_ShameThatWe=Shame that we couldn't get that last probe deployed. The ICC really counts on those scans.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_SuccessStreak_IG_001_ThoseLastFew=Those last few probes you helped me with, we've been getting some really fanastic data. Who knows, maybe at this rate I'll be a first class junior cartographer soon!
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_SuccessStreak_IG_002_TheMoreOf=The more of those probes you deploy for us, the clearer picture we're getting of the system. It's been a huge help.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Success_IG_003_YouShouldSee=You should see some of the scans coming in from the last probe you deployed. I mean, it would probably just look like a jumble of numbers to you, but take it from me, it's very exciting.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Success_IG_004_WantedToLet=Wanted to let you know that we've gotten some really interesting data from the last probe, so thanks again for deploying it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Success_IG_005_IveBeenSpending=I've been spending a lot of my shift pouring over scans from that last probe. There's some really intriguing stuff coming through.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_UnderAttack_Fail_IG_001_DecidedToCome=Decided to come back and see if I was still alive? Well, despite a certain someone, I luckily am.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_UnderAttack_Fail_IG_002_IveBeenThinking=I've been thinking about how that last attack went down and I have to say, it might be worth spending a few more hours training in a flight sim. You know, so you don't let down the next person who relies on you.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_UnderAttack_Fail_IG_003_JustThoughtId=Just thought I'd tell you that I forgive you for what happened during the attack. You tried, and that's what matters.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_UnderAttack_Success_IG_002_ThanksAgainFor=Thanks again for the help with that attack. I'm still a bit shaken up. I keep jumping at the smallest thing. There was a commercial for popcorn on last night and I nearly had a heart attack.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_UnderAttack_Success_IG_003_IKeepThinking=I keep thinking about the attack, imagining how many different ways it could have gone wrong... Kind of amazing how many things had to go right for both of us to get through that alive.

PU_BANISTER_MG_MidMission_Probe_EncourageFinish_IG_001_JustOutOf=Just out of curiosity, I did ask you to place a probe for me, right? I'm pretty sure I did, but maybe I just thought about doing it, and.. oh wait, no, have it here in my notes. Probe. Awesome. As soon as you have it in position, let me know.

PU_BANISTER_MG_MidMission_Probe_EncourageRepos_IG_002_GreatSinceThe=Great. Since the probe is in place, all that's left is to sync the signal and ... I don't understand. It should be sending - Ohhhh. I think I know what's wrong. It's the positioning. Looks like you're going to have to go back and deploy it somewhere else. Here, let me update the coordinates.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MidMission_Probe_EncourageRepos_IG_003_OkayTheProbes=Okay, the probe is in position, so let me run a quick diagnostic. <pause> Crap. That's not gonna work. Looks like we might have to reposition the probe a bit. You mind going back and adjusting its positioning? I'm really sorry.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_1stXIntro_IG_001_SeeSometimesI=See, sometimes I accidentally pick up distress beacons that are outside of ECN range, but if I went chasing after all of them, I'd totally lose my job, not to mention get blown up by outlaws. But on the other hand, it's not like I can just sit here and do nothing, so I try to pass them along and get help when I can. And that's where you come in. If I give you the coordinates, I was hoping you could maybe see if there's anything you could do?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_Generic_IG_001_ShootingYouThe=Shooting you the location of a distress beacon. It is going off hard. You gotta help them. Code of space and all, right?

Cause I realized I might be the only who calls them DB. Feel free to start using it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_Generic_IG_004_DropWhateverYour=Drop whatever your doing. Two words. Distress bacon. Beacon. Distress beacon. Sorry. I didn't have breakfast. Forget it. Just go help, okay?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_Generic_IG_005_ImPickingUp=I'm picking up a faint distress beacon on my scanners. I'll send you the coordiates. Might wanna be careful though, I was just reading about an outlaw pack that liked to use them to lure people into ambushes. Not that it should stop you from looking. Just, you know, don't get ambushed.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_Generic_IG_006_PickingUpA=Picking up a distress beacon signal at these coordinates. If you check it out, be careful.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PostMsg_IG_001_ItDoesNot=It does not sound good. Sending you the location of the signal. I think you should go try to help. I mean, you don't have to. You can do what you want, or whatever. But after hearing this - are you really not going to?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PostMsg_IG_002_TheyreUnderAttack=They're under attack. Here are the coordinates. You've gotta hurry!

PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PostMsg_IG_005_ImSendingYou=I'm sending you their location, though to be honest, by the time you get there, not sure how much good you'll be... And I just won the pessismist of the year award. Sorry. Good luck, okay?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PostMsg_IG_006_ItsComingFrom=It's coming from these coordinates. You should help if you can.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PreMsg_IG_001_ListenToThis=Listen to this.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PreMsg_IG_002_IJustGot=(frantic) I just got a comm. Here -
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PreMsg_IG_003_QuickQuestionFor=Quick question for you. This sounds serious, right?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PreMsg_IG_004_ReadyForYour=Ready for your unsettling comm of the day? And, yeah. Nightmares for a week.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PreMsg_IG_005_JustWhenYou=Just when you start to forget that space can be pretty terrible you hear something like this-
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PreMsg_IG_006_EmergencyCommJust=Emergency comm just came in -
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Generic_IG_001_IPickedUp=I picked up this job posting off the public spec and thought it might be your kinda thing. Sending it over.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Generic_IG_002_FiguredIdPass=Figured I'd pass this along in case your interested in some extra work.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Generic_IG_003_IDontKnow=I don't know if you're busy or just out coasting, but check this out.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Generic_IG_004_SawAJob=Saw a job that you might be interested in. I'll send it over.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Generic_IG_005_IfYoureOn=If you're on the hunt for some credits, and I mean, who doesn't need credits, there's a local posting that could be perfect for you. Here.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_NoAvailable_IG_001_ImSorryTo=I'm sorry to say, but I don't really have anything exciting to tell you at the moment. Pretty boring here, actually. Well, other than the varied and exciting opportunties afforded me as an employee of the ICC, of course.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_NoAvailable_IG_002_GuessWhatTheres=Guess what? There's absolutely nothing going on at the moment. To be honest, if you hadn't shown up when you did, I'd probably be taking a desk nap right now.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_NoAvailable_IG_003_IDontReally=I don't really have anything to give you right now. Unless of course, you're in the mood to do some laundry. Just kidding, I don't actually want you to do my laundry.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_1stXIntro_IG_001_IfYoureInterested=If you're interested, I could use a hand deploying one of our smaller scan probes. They're what we use to survey the areas that the large probes have a hard time seeing. All you'd have to do is pick one up from the depot, deploy it at the specified coordinates, and then come back here so I can do the final sync and verify everything's working. Best part is, I have a budget to hire contractors with, so you'd actually get paid. Take a look and see what you think.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Generic_IG_001_IHaveA=I have a new location that we need a probe deployed to. Think you can help?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Generic_IG_002_JustGotThe=Just got the coordinates for a new probe deployment site. Any interest?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Generic_IG_003_IfYouHappen=If you happen to be in the mood to deploy some scan probes, today is your lucky day. Take a look.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Generic_IG_004_SomeNewAnalysis=Some new analysis came in and it seems we need some more detailed scans for a particular sector. I was hoping you could deploy the probe for me. What do you say?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Generic_IG_005_WereTryingTo=We're trying to get a more detailed picture of a sector, which means additional scan probes need to be deployed, which means potential work for you. What do you think?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostRecover_IG_001_WeLostContact=We lost contact with one of the probes before it could transfer all of its scan data. I need someone to go recover it and take it to the depot, so we can salvage what we can. Here, I'm sending you the specifics.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostRecover_IG_002_TheresAScan=There's a scan probe on the fritz. I was hoping you could grab it and take it to the depot for me. What do you think?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostRecover_IG_003_SoItSeems=So it seems that a scan probe - one of my favorites by the way - is having a few problems. Signal's going in an out. Weird anomalous readings. The works. But I'm hoping that we can still salvage the little guy. You up for grabbing it and taking it to the depot for me?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostReplace_IG_001_OneOfOur=One of our probes went down and needs to be replaced. Straightforward enough except that whatever took out the probe in the first place might still be there. Maybe outlaws? Maybe a storm? I don't know. Here, take a look.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostReplace_IG_002_GotAReport=Got a report this morning that one of the probes went offline. Not sure what happened. One minute it was humming away nicely. Next minute, nothing. Would be lovely if you could deploy a replacement. Just might want to be extra careful when you out there. Interested?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostReplace_IG_003_ANewBlind=A new blindspot just appeared in the grid. Seems that a probe went down. It's actually a little suspicous if you ask me. Probes don't usually just switch off like that on their own. Either way, the end result is the same. We have to replace it ASAP. You up for a run?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Repos_IG_001_IveBeenGetting=I've been getting a bit of interference on one of the scan probes and I was hoping that you might be able to move into a better position for me. Here are the details.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Repos_IG_002_AllTheData=All the data I'm getting back from one of the scan probes isn't making much sense. I think it might need to be repositioned. Here, have a look.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Repos_IG_003_IveBeenScratching=I've been scratching my head over this distorted data set that we've been getting from one of the scan probes. I've tried everything on this end, but at this point, I think the only way to sort it is to physicaly reposition the probe itself. Which, as you may be guessing, is why I'm mentioning it to you. Feel like doing a bit of reorganizing for me?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_001_NotToSound=Not to sound mysterious or anything, but I'm picking up some really weird pings on my scanners. I don't know if you'd want to check it out and tell me what the hell it is. I would myself, but, you know, I can't leave. <pause> Sorry, forgot the coordinates.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_002_SomethingKindaOdd=Something kinda odd just popped up on my screen and it might be worth checking out. I mean, you don't have to. Might be something cool though... or it could be a chunk of aluminium. I don't know. But I guess that's the point right? Neither of us will know unless you go and see.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_003_SoImGetting=So I'm getting a strange signal on my scan. It's saying it can't ID it. That's odd, right? ID'ing stuff is kind of what scans do. Anyway, not mine apparently, cause I have no clue what they found. Giving you the cords if you're interested in scoping it out.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_004_OneOfMy=One of my probes... God, that's a weird lead-off... I just picked up an odd reading. Might be worth checking out.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_005_IfYouHave=If you have a second. Could you check out these coordiates? Scans are saying something's there, but can't ID it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_006_MySystemsStuck=My system's stuck processing an unknown reading. I'd love to be able to provide more information on my report than just like five question marks in a row. Think you could take a look at what's at this location?
PU_BANISTER_MG_PerformanceWarning_IG_001_ImNotReally=I'm not really sure what's going on with you. I keep thinking you're going to be able to handle stuff, but then I keep finding out that stuff has definitely not been handled and it's beginning to make me wonder if I should maybe not be giving you stuff at all. But who knows, maybe this time's the charm.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PerformanceWarning_IG_002_IReallyAppreciate=I really appreciate that you're trying to help me out, but at a certain point you're starting to become more of a hinderance. If you can't actually start helping, I'm going to stop asking.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PerformanceWarning_IG_003_ThisIsA=This is a bit awkward, but I got to say it, you've been having a really hard time out there and it seems like no matter what I ask for your help with, it's just not happening. I think you can do better, but if you can't then, well... then I might have to just accept that it's not going to work.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerAcceptsMission_IG_001_GreatGladYoure=Great, glad you're the one handling it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerAcceptsMission_IG_002_SoundsGood=Sounds good.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerAcceptsMission_IG_003_Fantastic=Fantastic.

PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerActingStrange_IG_001_AreYouFeeling=Are you feeling alright? You're acting a bit... odd.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerActingStrange_IG_002_OkImPretty=Okay. I'm pretty sure that's not normal.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerActingStrange_IG_003_IsThisA=Is this a joke? Are you messing with me?
PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerCollides_IG_001_WoahWatchIt=Woah! Watch it!
PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerCollides_IG_002_HeyCarefulWith=Hey, careful with the equipment!
PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerCollides_IG_003_AndIThoughtI=And I thought I was bad at flying.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerDeclinesMission_IG_001_OkayNoWorries=Okay. No worries.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerDeclinesMission_IG_002_ThatsFineI=That's fine. I can hopefully find someone else to handle it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerDeclinesMission_IG_003_IfYouThink=If you think that's best.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerDeclinesMission_IG_004_GotItNot=Got it. Not for you. Understood.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerDeclinesMission_IG_005_NotThisTime=Not this time. No problem.

PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerDeclinesMission_OpenEnded_IG_003_GimmeAHeads=Gimme a heads up if you end up deciding you want it after all.
PU_BANISTER_MG_Reward_IG_001_HereMyWay=Here. My way of saying thanks.
PU_BANISTER_MG_Reward_IG_002_IWantYou=I want you to have this. It's the least I could do.
PU_BANISTER_MG_Reward_IG_003_HereALittle=Here. A little something to show my gratitude.
PU_BANISTER_MG_SendPayment_IG_001_IllTransferThe=I'll transfer the credits to you now.
PU_BANISTER_MG_SendPayment_IG_002_AllRightSending=All right, sending your payment. Don't spend it all in one place. Unless you're in a bank. Then it's just good financial prudence.
PU_BANISTER_MG_SendPayment_IG_003_HereYouveEarned=Here. You've earned this.
PU_BANISTER_MG_SendPayment_IG_004_IllJustGo=I'll just go ahead and send over your payment.
PU_BANISTER_MG_SendPayment_IG_005_OkayEverythingSeems=Okay. Everything seems good on my end, let's get you paid.
PU_BANISTER_MG_Transition_IG_001_Anyway=Anyway ...
PU_BANISTER_MG_Transition_IG_002_EnoughAboutThat=Enough about that ...
PU_BANISTER_MG_Transition_IG_003_OkayMovingOn=Okay, moving on ...

PU_BANISTER_MG_UnderAttack_AllClear_IG_001_WaitIsThat=Wait. Is that it? Are they gone? Cause the scans are clear. Did we actually make it. I can't believe we made it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_UnderAttack_AllClear_IG_002_ThatWasIt=That was it! That was the last of them. We made it!
PU_BANISTER_MG_UnderAttack_AllClear_IG_003_LooksLikeIts=Looks like it's over for now.
PU_BANISTER_MG_UnderAttack_EncourageDefend_IG_001_YoureDoingGreat=You're doing great. Just keep shooting them.
PU_BANISTER_MG_UnderAttack_EncourageDefend_IG_002_NotToRush=Not to rush you, but the faster we take them out, the less likely they are to blow stuff up.

PU_BANISTER_MG_UnderAttack_HostilesArrive_More_IG_001_OhNoLooks=Oh no. Looks like they called in some friends. That can't be good for us.
PU_BANISTER_MG_UnderAttack_HostilesArrive_More_IG_002_IJustPicked=I just picked up some more trouble coming our way, and - oh, they're here already.
PU_BANISTER_MG_UnderAttack_HostilesArrive_More_IG_003_ReinforcementsLikeThings=Reinforcements! Like things weren't bad enough already.

PU_BANISTER_MG_UnderAttack_Thanks_IG_001_ICannotTell=I can not tell you enough how much I appreciate your help. I'm still not sure why they attacked. Maybe there's something they didn't want the ICC to scan? I just hope they don't come back.
PU_BANISTER_MG_UnderAttack_Thanks_IG_002_ThatWasClose=That was close. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't shown up when you did. Still can't believe we were attacked.

PU_BANISTER_MG_UnderAttack_Thanks_IG_003_WellThatEnded=Well, that ended a lot better than I thought it was going to. I can't help but wonder why they attacked in the first place. I thought everyone loved the ICC? I mean, who can hate a cartographer?
