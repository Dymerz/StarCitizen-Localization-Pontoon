mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_AboveAndBeyond_Text=Millions of people from around the Empire come to visit Crusader every year. From stunning vistas planetside to a bevy of unique and memorable locations in the surrounding environs, there’s plenty of reasons why Crusader is considered by many to be “Above and Beyond.”\n\nWhat better way to explore the grand expanses of the Crusader than by riding aboard a Genesis Starliner that was built planetside by Crusader Industries. These luxurious cruise ships offer tours of not only the gorgeous upper atmosphere of Crusader proper, but offer a myriad of options and destinations. Why not start with a sunset tour to see a Genesis being built right before your eyes in the beautiful latticework of Crusader Industries; expansive shipyards? From there you can cruise along to the lower atmosphere to experience the colorful cacophony of one of our famous “light storms” or head out into orbit to visit the beautiful icy moon of Yela. Named for the oldest sibling in the childhood favorite fairy tale “A Gift for Baba,” a visit to this frozen landscape will surely have all the makings of a tale of your own.\n  \nFor more information on tickets and timetables, or to learn more about places to see and visit during your stay, please contact the Crusader Visitor Information Center.

mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_Artists_Subtitle=Personal Datapad - Dreams, Thoughts, and Inspiration
mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_Artists_Text=/**MOBICONNECT.RETRIEVALSYSTEM.FRP…DATAFOUND**/\n\n•	Remember, this is a free flowing expression of your thoughts. Don’t hold back. Don’t edit. Be true and you will find truth.\n\n•	Impact over substance or transformation over rehabilitation?\n\n•	The medium is part of discussion as much as the discussion itself is a medium of the art, but when that message overcomes the piece, is that the ultimate goal? Should the work stand or topple? Stop to ask ‘what if’ but make sure the remaining question is always why.\n\n•	Found another critique - “Though the work is an assault on the space, there remains little bite behind the attack. The only kindness in the experience is that the all the leftover resin has been promised to a local art school. Hopefully it may find use as art yet.” This is what I need. This pain. \n\n•	While I had some concerns at first, I am thrilled that my new hab is proving a fruitful ground for inspiration. Leaving the comfortable familiar behind and embracing the chaos of Grim HEX has been so cathartic I have begun to count losing all my credits as a blessing. \n\n•	You see these other artists who “make it.” Denara with his looms lapping up the critic’s praise, or Tamsa and her painted ships. Their embracing of the commercialization of art is the very poison that is destroying our souls. To expose how deep this commoditization of Humanity would be a true work of inspiration.\n\n•	I watched an ambush today outside the base. It was thrilling and terrifying at the same time, but it was the aftermath that struck me the most. The silence after the predators had flown away, stripping the cargo of their prey, I found myself transfixed by the drifting hulk of the wreck. The twisted shapes losing all function and becoming pure form. Definitely a motif to be explored further. \n\n•	I met a woman today who goes by the name Threetoe. She told me that if she was to die she’d want to be floated out in the asteroids by ‘the Big Sister.” She explained how her mother used to read the ‘A Gift for Baba’ to her growing up and she always related to the character. It amazes me the impact these stories of our youth can shape our very being. What replaces them as we grow older? The stories stop, but the need persists. What are the fairy tales that give us comfort now? The answer came to me as my thoughts were interrupted by cries of “So Yum, So Wow” from a nearby Big Benny’s machine. This is how the story of Humanity will be told. This corrupt consumerism will be the monument that we leave behind. \n\n•	A monument for me to leave behind …\n\n
mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_Artists_Title=INSTALLATION 3 – IDEATION JOURNAL
mobiGlas_MissingBennys_Artist_mobi_Text=/**MOBICONNECT.RETRIEVALSYSTEM.FRP…DATAFOUND**/\n\nThe project is nearly finished. It's been a hard installation but the wonderful fatigue of my body is the most alive I have felt in months.  It took me all day, but I think I figured out how to fix the machine I've been having trouble balancing. Once I get that done, only two more to go. Nothing like overcoming challenges to reinvigorate the soul.\n\nI can feel in every essence of my being just how important this work will be.\n\nThe questions remains though, what is the best way to reveal this unprecedented work to humanity? Do I stay silent to allow the naturally curious be the chosen few, spreading the gospel of Benny until the masses descend upon the site eager to know real truth? Or do I anonymously message an art critic or two to help them along the way? \n\nIt is almost tempting to stay here and await their arrival just to see what their reaction will be.\n

mobiglas_AlphaStation_WelcomeMessage_BodyText=On behalf of our entire staff and Crusader Industries, thank you for choosing Port Olisar for your visit to the Crusader area. We realize that there are many fine stations available, so we sincerely appreciate your business and look forward to providing an enjoyable experience.\n\nWe would like to call your attention to two important services:\n\n*Accessing Your Ship*\nIf you arrived at the station in a personal craft, Port Olisar is proud to feature UniCorp Limited’s cutting edge all-in-one automated ship organization program, ASOP. To retrieve your vessel, visit one of the ASOP terminals located in the Ship Deck, and once selected, your ship will be delivered to an available landing pad. \n\n*Safety Protocols*\nFor the safety of our guests, Port Olisar has been declared an Armistice Zone. Combat is prohibited and the use of all personal and ship weapons is strictly limited.

We are sorry to inform you that after careful consideration and review, our investigation has revealed the cause of loss is not covered by the employee policy provided by Covalex Shipping.\n\nPersonal Life Policy 02107 02012000 notes the following exclusions under which benefits will not be paid if the loss:\n\n(A)	results from the Insured's alcoholism or addiction to drugs or narcotics; but not addiction which results from the administration of those substances in accordance with the advice and written instructions of a Licensed Health Care Practitioner.\n(B)	results from the Insured's participation in a felony, riot or insurrection, or involvement in an illegal occupation.\n\nThe preponderance of the evidence collected at Covalex Gundo Station and witness statements indicate that the insured was intoxicated to the point they he lost normal control of his mental and physical facilities and that this intoxication was a contributing cause of the accident.\n\nIt is against the law and considered a felony for an individual to cause the death of another by the operation of devices while under the influence of intoxicants. Even if there may be intervening factors between the fact of operation and the death of another. Felony exclusion makes no benefits payable. \n\nSince your claim was denied, you have the right to an internal appeal. You may request one by filling out a DCR-90 form. If you have questions regarding the information contained in this letter, please feel free to contact our claims department. \n\nSincerely,\n\nJessie Holzburg\n\nClaims Adjuster\nImperial General Insurance

But even if you find out he isn't, you'll still get paid. I know your time is valuable and really, I just want to know the truth.\n \nGood luck, and I hope to hear from you soon one way or another.

Needs to be more detail focused. One more strike? \n- Does a lot to help maintain crew morale. \n\nDarnell Ward Notes: \n- Was a little abrasive at first when he came back, but has settled back into a solid routine. Once in a while still have to remind him about watching his attitude. \n- Punctuality problems seemed to have gone away. Has been on time regularly for past 3 months. \n- Keeps personal space clean. \n- Can sometimes be too diligent in trying to figure out a problem. Over thinks things sometimes which means tasks can take a little longer than expected. \n- Also can lead to taking unnecessary risks. \n- Very proactive though. Will address issues without needing to be told to do so. \n\nNico Theolone Notes: \n- Very focused. \n- Gets job done. \n- Figure out how to mention deodorant thing??? \n\nKiyomi Santos Notes: \n- So far so good. Seems to be stepping into the position well. \n- Good attitude. \n- Reports could be a little cleaner. Have noticed a few typos and errors. Simple things. Should take the time to double check before filing. \n- Schedule rotation suggestion was a good one. \n- Possible candidate for advanced training \n\nMel Ososky Notes: \n- Needs to be more mindful of using mobiGlas during work hours. \n- Has helped to improve the distro rate. Moving more crates through thanks to oversight on the cargo manifests. \n- Can be territorial with responsibilities. Needs to be more willing to let others help. \n\nSelf Eval Notes: \n- Need to be better about respecting that personal hours. I have sometimes taken advantage of employees living onsite and it can blur the lines between on and off hours. Downtime is important. \n- Profits have exceeded the 3% growth mandated by Covalex, in large part to my management. \n- Employee retention has increased. Turnover rate has significantly dropped. \n- Need to be better about following up on things earlier. Don't assume employees are tracking deadlines.

mtps_RetrieveConsignment_desc_001=ABOUT THE JOB\nmicroTech Protection Services need a security professional for a retrieval op at ~mission(Location). The location is currently under attack and security forces on-site are unresponsive and presumed dead. We believe confidential materials recently delivered to the facility for temporary holding were the target of the raid.

The materials have unique retrieval codes that must be entered on the keypad at the package conveyor. Protocols require that only senior security officers can carry a datapad containing a code, so you’ll have to locate them before retrieving the boxes. Once secured, deliver all of the confidential materials to ~mission(dropoff1) for payment.\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n• Provide own transportation to ~mission(Location|address).\n• Use force as necessary to collect the confidential materials.\n• Deliver the confidential materials to ~mission(dropoff1|address).\n\nMINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS\n• 2 years of combined mercenary and/or security experience.\n• Access to combat equipment. \n• Access to a spaceship that can transport cargo.\n• Available for immediate deployment.\n\nPREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS\n• Experience with rapid hostility de-escalation techniques.\n• Experience hauling important cargo.

murderspree_desc=~mission(DistractionKillDescription|Description)
murderspree_desc_0001=I got a bit of a sob story for you. Year ago to the day, Navy squad came and dusted some of my best. Spaced 'em in the middle of a job with nary a warnin'. Hardly seems right. \n\nNow I'm thinkin' it's about time to settle the score. Heard that there was a level 5 in system and it's too good of a chance to pass up. See, as long as your crimestat's that high, the brave little starmen are gonna be huntin' you down anytime security gets wind of ya. Here's what I say, let 'em. \n\nEvery one of them blues that comes to hunt you, you take them out first. Get ~mission(KillCount) of them and I figure that'll be justice for my crew and a fine payout for you.   \n\nOne little bit extra - once you land the first shot, I need you to do it all in a set amount of time: ~mission(KillTime). The same as it took them to wipe us out. Call me sentimental. 
murderspree_desc_0002=Since you're a level 5, I'm assuming you're one crazy bastard. Exactly the type I need to settle a bet I have going. \n\nMy idiot friend says there's no way someone could take out ~mission(KillCount) Navy starmen in ~mission(KillTime). I say that all you need is the right person for the job. Plus, as long as your crimestat stays that high, any security you run into should summon the Navy right to you. Easy pickings.  \n\nWhat do you say? Do it and half the winnings are yours. The timer starts as soon as you shoot the first one.\n\n
murderspree_desc_0003=I'm sure you're aware, but recently the Navy's been trying to clean up Stanton. As someone who's clearly no fan of the law, that's pretty bad for you, and even worse for me. I work for one of the big security firms in the system (not saying which) and all our jobs have dried up since the Navy started taking on a larger role.\n\nWhat I need is a disaster that can prove to the suits with the credits that the Navy aren't the saviors they think they are. \n\nYou're going to be my disaster.\n\nI'll pay you some serious credits to take out ~mission(KillCount) Navy starmen in under ~mission(KillTime). And with your crimestat at level 5, the heroic Navy will show up any time you run into security making it that much simpler. I’ll start the time once the first shot lands. Figure a spree of this magnitude should be enough to scare just about anyone into hiring my firm.

northrock_boarders_890J_VIP_title_001,P=URGENT: VIP in danger
northrock_boarders_890J_desc_001=An executive client just informed us that their 890 Jump had been intercepted at ~mission(Location) and boarded by outlaws. They would prefer to have this handled privately owing to the sensitive nature of proprietary data that's being stored aboard. \n\nYour first priority will be to clear all outlaws as quickly as possible so that a recovery team can be dispatched to return the ship to the owner. The longer the outlaws have control of the vessel, the higher the chance it will be lost. I recommend you acquire a team for this outing to expedite matters. \n\nNote that thanks to a small contingent of Security Personnel who stayed aboard, all surviving members of the crew were able to flee in an escape craft. The current status of the remaining security is unknown, but just in case, keep an eye out for friendlies when you engage the hostiles.\n\nSecondly, if at all possible, the client is *very* interested in preventing the theft of the aforementioned data. If you are able to stop the theft of their confidential data stores before they are transmitted, a generous bonus will be issued.\n\nNeedless to say, this is a client I would very much like to keep happy. \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_boarders_890J_title_001=URGENT: Boarding Action In Progress
northrock_bounty_PVP_desc_001=We have received a contract to track down a suspect by the name of ~mission(TargetName) who has so far managed to evade capture. \n\nI was hoping you that with your guild certification, you'd be able to handle this one for us. Expect them to be more difficult that your average target.\n\nGood luck,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_PVP_desc_002=Have another skip for you to track down -  ~mission(TargetName).\n\nThis suspect is probably going to be trickier than average to bring in so try to stay a step or two ahead of them and you should be alright.\n\nThanks for handling this,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_PVP_desc_003=Got a suspect by the name of ~mission(TargetName) that needs to be brought in. Heads up though, they are a bit of wildcard. Not sure what you might come up against trying to apprehend them. Sure you can handle it though.\n\nGood luck,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_PVP_desc_first=Hi,\n\nHope you don't mind but I was made of your Bounty Hunters Guild status and wanted to reach out and see if you would be interesting in contracting with Northrock Service Group, one of the top rated private security firms in the system.\n\nIf you are interested, the first step would be complete a pro tem suspect apprehension. It's less of an evaluation and more of a chance to make sure that we can have a good working relationship. \n\nThe suspect you would be after is known as ~mission(TargetName). They are known to be particularly elusive so you may have your work cut out for you.\n\nHope to hear from you soon, \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_PVP_desc_rehire=Hey again,\n\nIt's been a little while, hope everything's okay. I know things didn't end on the best terms, but after discussing it over with management, I would like to offer you a chance to redeem yourself. You had potential and I hate to think that you didn't have a proper chance to show what you're capable of.\n\nApprehend ~mission(TargetName) and we can see about getting your employment status reinstated.\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_PVP_title_001=Apprehend Suspect: ~mission(TargetName)
northrock_bounty_PVP_title_first=Pro Tem Suspect Apprehension
northrock_bounty_PVP_title_rehire=Pro Tem Suspect Apprehension (Reevaluation)
northrock_bounty_desc_001=Got issued another bounty that we could use you on. This one's for ~mission(TargetName). I don't expect them to go down easy, but that shouldn't be a problem for you. They're last know location was at ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nSee that you get it done,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_desc_002=Your services are needed once again. This time to track and bring down the notorious ~mission(TargetName). They were last seen at ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nDo me a favor and keep it as clean as you can, okay? Might be extra eyes on this one.\n\nThanks for handling this,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_desc_003=Have a bounty for you. ~mission(TargetName). Not the most high-profile collar, but a nasty piece of work nonetheless. Be good for everyone in the system to have this settled. Their last known location was at ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nGood luck on the hunt,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_desc_first=Hey,\n\nHope everything is going all right. I may have reached out to you already, but just in case, I wanted to message you again. I'm a logistics officer for the Stanton branch of Northrock Service Group, one of the top rated private security firms in the system, and we are looking to expand our portfolio of qualified contractors.\n\nNow, even though you are certified by the Bounty Hunters Guild, Northrock will need you to complete a pro tem contract to make sure you're a good match. I'm thinking I'll start you off collecting the bounty on ~mission(TargetName). They were last seen at ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nGet that done and we'll see about getting you more work.\n\nHope to hear from you soon, \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_desc_rehire=So, enough time has passed that I got management to agree to giving you a second chance at being a bounty hunter for Northrock. If you are able to prove yourself capable of successfully completing a contract that is.\n\nApprehend ~mission(TargetName) and we can see about getting you reinstated. They were last seen at ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_fps_UGF_boss_desc_001=Hey, \n\nHave an interesting bounty for you. A high level criminal by the name ~mission(TargetName) has been located at ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nBased on our intel, its highly unlikely that the target’s going to be sitting and waiting out in the open. You most likely will have to infiltrate the facility and draw them out. \n\nSomething like a large firefight should be enough to do the trick. \n\nBest of luck,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group\n
northrock_bounty_fps_UGF_boss_nocivs_desc_001=Hey, \n\nGot a contract for you that requires a bit more tactics than usual. A high-level criminal by the name ~mission(TargetName) is hiding with a large contingent of outlaws at ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nOur intel suggests that ~mission(TargetName|Last)’s forces most likely will act as defensive line in order to protect their boss. My best guess is that you will have to deal with them before you gain access to ~mission(TargetName|Last).\n\nThat said, I don’t want you shooting indiscriminately. Sometimes these outlaws keep civilians around and they should be treated like non-combatants.\n\nBest of luck,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group\n
northrock_bounty_fps_title_001=Bounty Assignment: ~mission(TargetName) (?RT)
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_001=Convicted criminal ~mission(TargetName) has escaped from a local rehab facility and Northrock's been contracted to return the inmate to custody. In my experience, escaped prisoners tend not to give up peacefully, so use any method you can to find and subdue the escapee. \n\nMight be worth staking out spots where they could attempt to hack their record clean. Wouldn't be the first time a prisoner has tried to wipe their sentence after escaping.\n\nGood hunting,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_002=Northrock received a bounty on a prison escapee that goes by the name ~mission(TargetName). They'll probably try to lay low for awhile, but the best way for them to do that is to hack their record clean. I'd start by checking out local spots where they might be able to gain access to the network.\n\nAnd word of warning - expect a fight. People fresh our of jail tend to have extra motivation for not going back.\n\nGood hunting,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_003=Hey,\n\nGot a bit of a livewire for you. Convicted criminal ~mission(TargetName) managed to escape from lockup and are on the run.\n\nNo clear sign where they might be headed, but I'd say check any spots in the area where they might be able to hack their record clear. The smarter crooks tend to start there. \n\nBet they are not going to be happy about running into you.\n\nGood hunting,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_intro=Hey There,\n\nMy name is Braden Corchado and I'm a logistics officer for Northrock Service Group, the leading independently-owned security firm operating in the Stanton system. I may have reached out already, but we try to make it a point of approaching anyone who meets our high standards and encouraging them to complete a pro tem contract. \n\nYou can't do much better than become a Northrock contractor. We have a solid reputation for offering challenging and interesting work at a higher rate of pay then many of our competitors in system. \n\nNow, to get approved, you will need to apprehend one ~mission(TargetName). They have recently escaped from the detention center and your job will be to track them down before they can disappear completely off the grid. \n\nA little hint is that it's safe to assume that the target is going to go try to clear their record. I recommend triangulating your search between the detention center they escaped from and locations where they can hack into the record system.\n\nGet this done and we'll see about getting you more work.\n\nHope to hear from you soon, \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group 
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_rehire=Hey,\n\nI know it's been a little while, but if you are still interested in doing contract work for Northrock, I convinced the management to give you a reevaluation. If you can successfully complete a bounty for us, we can see about getting your employment status reinstated.\n\nThis pro tem contract is to track down escaped criminal ~mission(TargetName). Try your best to get to them before they can wipe their record at database access point or the job's going to be significantly more difficult.\n\nHoping we can trust you on this.\n \nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group

northrock_groupbounty_desc_01=Local law just bounced us a group warrant. They're looking for the capture of several individuals wanted in connection with a major heist, aka ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3).\n\nTake care of the lot in the time allotted, and we're looking a fairly sizable payday. \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_02=Advocacy have been hunting down a group, but haven't had much luck. Lucky for them, NorthRock is ready to pick up the slack.\n\nWe got a time restricted warrant for:\n- ~mission(Target1)\n- ~mission(Target2)\n- ~mission(Target3)\n\nBe careful when you engage the targets. I don't want any of them slipping the net and costing us credits. \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_03=I feel like you've proven yourself capable, so I think you should be able to handle this time restricted group warrant. \n\nWe're sending you out to neutralize ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3). They're most likely not flying together anymore, but at one point they were operating as a pretty cutthroat gang. Racked up quite the hefty felony list before they disbanded.\n\nIt'll be more dangerous trying to capture them all in time, but the payout should be worth it.\n\nFly smart,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_04=Authorities are pretty eager to capture a trio of outlaws in connection with recent crime spree: ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3). \n\nThey're in the wind at the moment, but I trust that you'll be able to track each and every one of them down.\n\nThe payout for apprehending all three should make up for the extra effort needed to capture them in time.\n\nGood luck,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_05=Northrock got handed a bounty for three criminal associates on the run: ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3). \n\nIf they're smart, chances are they split up, so be ready to hunt them down individually.\n\nGood news is that the pay should make dealing with tight time restriction and extra travel worth it.\n\nFly safe,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_intro=Hey,\n\nHope everything is going all right. I may have reached out already, but I wanted to be sure and introduce myself. I'm a logistics officer for Northrock Service Group, the leading independently-owned security firm operating in the Stanton system today, providing a variety of services to all major governmental bodies as well as various private concerns. The reason I am contacting you is because we believe someone with your skills could be a boon to our clients. \n\nNot only that, but I think we'd be good fit for you. Our contractors traditionally get a higher rate of pay than a lot of our competitors in system, and a lot of them tell me how they really enjoy being tasked with the challenging and interesting work we offer. \n\nNow, Northrock holds itself to such high-standards so before we can make anything official, you'll need to achieve approved contractor status by completing a pro tem contract. \n\nI was hoping you could capture several wanted members of an outlaw gang: ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3).\n\nGet that done and we'll see about getting you more work.\n\nHope to hear from you soon, \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group 
northrock_groupbounty_desc_rehire=Hey,\n\nI've been thinking over everything that went down and decided to speak to management. They've agreed to give you another chance but only if you successfully complete a contract for us.\n\nWe can look at reinstating your employment status if you can bring in this criminal trio:\n~mission(Target1)\n~mission(Target2)\n~mission(Target3)\n\nThey evaded the last Associate who went after them, so you bringing them all in would definitely earn you some points.\n\nHopefully you've gotten your act together since your last job.\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group

northrock_recoverspace_desc_0001=Bit of burner came in. A client of ours got robbed while in transit between systems. Current intel indicates that the job was pulled by a local thug named ~mission(TargetName). Thankfully, they still seem to have the stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoverSpaceItem) in their possession. \n\nNeed you to track this bastard down, recover the property, and return it to our client at ~mission(Destination). \n\nGood hunting,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_recoverspace_desc_0002=Just got a bit of good news. One of our sources got a tip on some stolen property we've been looking for. Seems that a shady character by the name of ~mission(TargetName) is transporting through the system.\n\nI want you to go find this ~mission(TargetName|Last), recover the stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoverSpaceItem) and drop it off at ~mission(Destination). \n\nThink you can take care of that?\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_recoverspace_desc_0003=So it seems that some missing ~mission(Contractor|RecoverSpaceItem) just turned up. Guess where? \n\nIn the back of a thief named ~mission(TargetName)'s ship. Don't know if they actually pulled the job or just ended up holding the stuff, but it's going to cost them big time.\n\nYou're going to go hunt ~mission(TargetName|Last) and convince them to give you the stolen property back. Once you've recovered everything, fly it back to ~mission(Destination). We can take it from there. \n\nGo out there and get it done,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group

outlawsweep_combatpay_0001=In addition to the standard contract payment, there will be a bonus issued for each combatant you successfully neutralize. 
outlawsweep_combatpay_0002=Unfortunately, we've been unable to determine the size of the force you'll be up against, but will issue you Hazard Pay for each hostile you manage to deal with successfully. 
outlawsweep_combatpay_0003=I've also been cleared to issue Hazard Pay that scales for each outlaw you take care of. 
outlawsweep_combatpay_0004=And to preemptively answer your question, yes, in addition to the normal flat fee there will be Hazard Pay issued for each hostile you clear from the site. 
outlawsweep_desc_0001=Word has just arrived that a group associated with the notorious ~mission(Client) gang has been spotted at ~mission(Location). While their intentions remain uncertain, we can all agree that it is too dangerous to allow them to carry out whatever misdeeds they are hoping to accomplish. \n\nCrusader is forming a combat response team ASAP. Grab whatever gear you'll need and head over to ~mission(Location) on the double. ~mission(CombatPay)And please, try to be safe!\n\nCONTRACT AUTHORIZED BY:\nLiaison Officer Bautista\nID# 948J030K
outlawsweep_desc_0002=Outlaws identified as members of the ~mission(Client) have been seen infilitrating a ~mission(Location). We've been after these particular bad eggs for a while now, so as you can imagine ~mission(Contractor) is pretty eager to assemble a team to deal with them. ~mission(CombatPay)\n\nIf you're interested, grab whatever gear you'll need and get going. It'd be great if we could settle this whole thing as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nCONTRACT AUTHORIZED BY:\nLiaison Officer Bautista\nID# 948J030K
outlawsweep_desc_0003=Armed members of a local criminal outfit, the ~mission(Client), were seen at ~mission(Location). We can only assume their intentions are hostile so a small team is being assembled to go and clear them out. ~mission(CombatPay) \n\nNow, since we don't want them to give us the slip, figured it would be wise to contact all operators in the area, regardless of skill or track record. If you're available — and I'm assuming you are — hurry up and grab your equipment. These ~mission(Client) are well overdue for their day of reckoning.\n\n\nCONTRACT AUTHORIZED BY:\nLiaison Officer Gibbs\nID# 91G66BW0
outlawsweep_desc_0004=Moments ago, we received a tip that several members of the ~mission(Client) outlaw organization were reported at ~mission(Location). It's vital that we stop them before they can commit any more criminal acts.\n\nTo that end, we're assembling a squad of armed and trained operators to go in and secure the site. ~mission(CombatPay)Contractors are expected to provide their own transportation and weapons. I feel like shouldn't have to say that, but you'd be surprised how many so-called 'professionals' accept a contract thinking they can borrow some from us. Next thing you'll know they'll be asking us to squeeze the trigger for them too. \n\n\nCONTRACT AUTHORIZED BY:\nLiaison Officer Gibbs\nID# 91G66BW0
