I expect you to maintain that privacy at all times. \n\nThe second is that I expect a certain level of professionalism from those whom I deem to work with. What you do in your own time is of course no of my concern, but when you are engaged in a contract you should endeavor to be efficient, timely, and discreet. \n\nFollow those criterion and there is every hope that we should have a long and fruitful partnership.\n\nSincerely,\nVaughn

Not gonna get into the details of what it was doing out there. Let's just say I'm okay cutting ties with the ship, but there's a special package on there that I can't leave to the mercs. Client paid out serious creds, so I can't just let it drift.\n\nWant you to get aboard the October Rising, get my shit, and get out. \n\nWord is that security are still on site so you might wanna pull together a crew if you got 'em. If you're feeling really highline, shut down the nearest comm array to cover your tracks. Point is, they probably won't react well to you showing up, but just remember they aren't the priority.\n\nDrop the package off at the clinic on Grim HEX and we'll transfer the creds.

assassin_danger_0001=If even half the rumors about them are true, you're going to want to take them out long before they see you coming.Â 
assassin_danger_0002=Apparently, this is supposed to be one of the more dangerous hitters in the sector. Do not make the mistake of underestimating them.Â 
assassin_danger_0003=Make sure to bring your full arsenal when you go hunting. Something tells me you might need it to take them down.Â 
assassin_danger_0004=Word of warning, no way someone like ~mission(TargetName|Last) is going down easy. You want to take them out? Do it hard and fast.Â 
assassin_danger_0005=While you should be careful, cause you never know - my guess is that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is gonna drop easy. Poor sod chooses to fly solo and hardly ever bothers with anything more than a few escorts.Â 
assassin_danger_0006=As for gearing up for this little job, you shouldn't need anything out of the ordinary. ~mission(TargetName|Last) prefers to fly alone. I mean, for a real special occasion they might travel with a friend or two, but I'd be surprised.Â Â 
assassin_danger_0007=Apparently, there's a good chance this scav's not gonna be traveling alone either. Seems that their little multicrew ship hardly ever flies without at least one or two friends along for the trip.Â Â 
assassin_danger_0008=Word is that the small multicrew ship ~mission(TargetName|Last) captains is being guarded by a few hired escorts. Can't say for sure if it's true, but good to be careful just in case.Â Â 
assassin_danger_0009=Rumor has it that ~mission(TargetName|Last) typically travels with a full escort so be ready to hit hard. Even if you do get lucky and catch them alone, you'll still have their ship to deal with and supposedly they captain a bit of a beast.Â 
assassin_danger_0010=Make sure to bring your full arsenal when you go hunting. Since ~mission(TargetName|Last) usually captains a bigger multicrew ship and springs the extra credits for escort, something tells me you might need the extra firepower.Â 
assassin_desc=~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDescription)

assassin_desc_0002=Got a mess that needs cleaning up. Paying solid credits for it too. The mess goes by the name of ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(Danger) \n\nBuddy of mine saw them around ~mission(Location), but the rest is up to you. ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_0003=There's a price on ~mission(TargetName)'s head. ~mission(MultiPlayer)Credits go to whoever bags the bastard first. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) I'd recommend starting at ~mission(Location) but hey, don't let me tell you how to do your job. ~mission(Danger)
assassin_desc_0004=Guess who just got themselves placed onto the 'no-breathe-list'? Some dragger named ~mission(TargetName). Yeah, I never heard of them either, but better them than us, right? \n\n~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer)Word is they've been haunting ~mission(Location) lately, so you'll probably want to start there. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)Good luck.
assassin_desc_0005=I don't know what ~mission(TargetName) did, but they sure pissed off the wrong people. Credits go to whoever can give them a last lesson in manners straight through the head. ~mission(Danger) \n\nThere isn't much to go on, just some scattered sightings around ~mission(Location), so maybe start there. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)~mission(MultiPlayer)One last thing, the client wants you to say '~mission(Phrase).' when the trigger's pulled. Don't ask. Just do it. 
assassin_desc_0006=~mission(TargetName) is breathing borrowed air. Time's come to punch their ticket for good. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) I can give you ~mission(Location) but you have to provide your own transport and clean weapons. ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer)
assassin_desc_0007=You know how they say the good die young? It's definitely true in this case. A hit's been put out on ~mission(TargetName), a local security thug that's hellbent on being a hero. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer)
assassin_desc_0008=Why don't these security assholes ever learn to mind their own damn business? It's like they want to get murdered. Especially this one. Name's ~mission(TargetName). Been stirring up huge trouble lately, but you're gonna put a permanent end to that.\n\n~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger) Knowing these security types, don't be surprised if they call for back up.
assassin_desc_0009=About time someone put ~mission(TargetName) in their place. This security hackjob's been taking bribes to look the other way, but the greedy little idiot decided to raise the rates. Big mistake! \n\nNow instead of those credits going to pay the smug bastard off, they're being used to pay you to murder their ass. That's some poetic justice right there. ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_0010=This bounty hunter by the name of ~mission(TargetName) made the mistake of messing with the wrong crew. They're looking to even the score and are offering pretty decent creds to whoever does the deed. ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_0011=I love it. This is one of those classic 'the hunter has become the hunted' scenarios you always see on the spec.Â \n\nA big bounty's been placed on the head of bounty hunter ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(Danger) It'll be interesting to see how they like it when they tables are turned. ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_easy=~mission(Contractor|AssassinationEasyDescription)
assassin_desc_first=Listen, I know you don't know me, but that's kinda the point of this little experiment. We're just two complete strangers helping each other out.Â \n\nHere's how this works - I give you a name. ~mission(TargetName), for example. Then I'll tell you a place: ~mission(Location). Now, if by some complete and utter coincidence, they wind up shot to death a little while later, a bunch of credits will mystically appear in your account. Long story short, ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) has some bad luck, you have some good luck. Everybody's happy.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of other people eager for the help of a dependable stranger and if you do a good job here, I'll make sure they know you're the stranger to talk to.\n\nGood luck out there.

bitzeros_RetrieveConsignment_desc_001=Hey,\n\nSome interesting intel just spun into our orbit. Seems ~mission(location|address) got some confidential materials delivered to them on the sly. Anything theyâre going those lengths to hideâs got to be worth something, right? Thatâs why weâre shelling out primo creds to anyone willing to breach the facility, snag the confidential materials, and drop them off at ~mission(dropoff1|address) for us.\n\nGonna be honest with you, part of why weâre not doing this one ourselves is itâs probably gonna be a mess. See, the confidential materials arrived alongside other boxes in a consignment now stored in their automated vault and the retrieval codes for that are only generated on-site. That means no remote hacking. Our source claims senior staff carry datapads with the codes on it, so youâll have to liberate datapads off them before using the codes at the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. \n\nBut the gigâs got some perks. The consignment includes other crates that we donât really give a crap about that are probably worth something too. \n\nSo what do you say?\n\n- Bit Zeros \n

blacjac_RetrieveConsignment_desc_001=ATTN: Mercenaries with Cargo Handling Experience\n\nNine Tails are currently assaulting one of our facilities at ~mission(Location|address). As they just received a delivery of confidential materials, we donât believe this is a coincidence. BlacJac needs someone to hurry to the location and secure these important boxes before the Nine Tails do. You are authorized to use lethal force against any who attempt to stop you. \n\nAs part of our standard security protocol, the confidential materials were integrated into another consignment and secured in the automated vault. Youâll need to find the relevant retrieval codes for the consignment and enter it at the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. Retrieval codes are stored locally on datapads and only given to high-ranking staff, so youâll have to locate them first. Hopefully theyâre alive to help you, but considering the complete comms blackout, we fear thatâs not the case.  \n\nOnce youâve gathered all the confidential materials, they will need to be delivered to ~mission(dropoff1|address).

I need you to get down there and destroy the drugs theyâre storing on site.\n\nThere's a good chance the facility isn't abandoned, so you might run into these thugs when you head down there, so be ready for a fight.

blacjac_bounty_desc_HRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nYour next bounty, ~mission(TargetName), is definitely considered a high-risk target for good reason.

blacjac_bounty_desc_LRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nBounty came in for a low-risk target by the name of ~mission(TargetName). The target themselves isnât all that much to worry about, but it seems that they typically fly in a pack, so thereâs a high chance theyâll have a few friends along when you track them down.\n\nSpeaking of, Iâd start the hunt over at ~mission(Location|Address) since we have reports of them being spotted in the area.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_bounty_desc_MRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nNeed you to sort out ~mission(TargetName), a moderate-risk bounty last seen at ~mission(Location|Address) flying a small, multicrew ship. \n\nWe werenât able to get details on exactly what they were piloting, but it seems they did have a few other ships with them.

blacjac_bounty_desc_VLRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nGot a very low-risk target I need you to take care of: ~mission(TargetName).\n\nTheir last known location was ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nThis is a low threat bounty, so I expect you to be able to clear it pretty fast.

blacjac_bounty_desc_intro=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nNot sure if youâre interested, but BlacJac is looking to expand our roster of bounty hunters.

Even got a test case all lined up â we want you to sort out ~mission(TargetName). They were last seen at ~mission(Location|Address).

blacjac_destroyprobe_desc_0001=ATTN: Mercenaries with Demo Experience\n\nWe have a problem over at ~mission(Location|Address). Apparently someone set up PDC Monitors to illegally skim data. \n\nYou are being tasked with locating the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) and destroying them. \n\nThere are a few possible complications:\n- These things are designed to operate passively with as low of an EM sig as possible. Finding them might take some effort and thorough scanning. \n- Monitors like these often have automatic security protocols so that if they are attacked, they begin to transmit any stored dated. It's vital you destroy them before the upload can finish.\n- ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)\n- ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nI'm hopeful you'll be able to resolve the issue before any more data is stolen.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_destroyprobe_desc_0002=ATTN: Mercenaries with Demo Experience\n\nReceived a report that some enterprising criminal has been skimming data from ~mission(Location|Address) using PDC Monitors. \n\nYou are being tasked to locate the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) and destroy them. I suspect it might take a bit of scanning to locate the monitors as they're designed to operate passively. Plus, as soon as you start attacking, their security countermeasures are going to kick in and attempt to upload their data-drives. You'll need to be fast enough to prevent the transfer. \n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nThanks for taking care of this,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_destroyprobe_desc_0003=ATTN: Mercenaries with Demo Experience\n\nI need a merc who can handle locating and destroying PDC monitors that have been illegally skimming data from ~mission(Location|Address). This will take some doing as the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) will be operating passively and difficult to find without performing a thorough scan of the area. Plus, you'll have to destroy the monitors before their emergency defense system uploads any more of the data they've stolen.\n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"

Basically, feel free to engage with any lowlifes you come across, but that's not what you're getting paid for - BlacJac's focus for this op is the drugs. \n\nGood luck,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"

Leadership's focus right now is the drugs, not the pushers because bodies are cheap.

ccdemo19_desc=Helluva job on that last gig. So good that when I was talking to a client of mine who works for some corp and was looking for a solid team. I instantly thought of you.\n\nTheir company heard that microTech is developing a cutting edge compression algorithm that could potentially put them out of business, so needless to say, they're very motivated in getting their hands on it and they're willing to pay handsomely.Â \n\nThe problem is that the program is being developed in one of microTech's off-site research facilities. Traffic into the base is heavily regulated, so you will need to steal an ID to make them think you are one of the workers. Security will be heavy, but I trust you will have ways to evade them.\n\nOnce you steal the code, I will provide you with a location for the drop away from prying eyes.
