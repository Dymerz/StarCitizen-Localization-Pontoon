PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Chatter_CommSilence_Ninetails_aEnemy_tPlayer_FromEnemy_inCombat_IG_004_NineTailsRuns=Nine Tails runs Crusader, and soon we're gonna be running all of Stanton. Nothing nobody can do about it.

PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Inform_Retreating_SecretPlan_aEnemy_tPlayer_FromEnemy_IG_003_EnoughThePlan=Enough! The plan said nothing about me needing to die.
PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Confirm_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereGot=Hey there. Got word that I should let you pass on through. But just a head's up, it'd be best if you didn't linger around here. Important Nine Tails business and all.
PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Confirm_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyHowsIt=Hey, how's it going. If you want to pass through here, you won't hear any objections from me. Just can't have you staying in the area for too long. You know, Nine Tails business.

PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Confirm_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_HeyItsFine=Hey, it's fine with the Nine Tails if you want to pass on through here. Just can't have you hang around okay?

PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Deny_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyIDont=Hey, I don't mean to be rude or nothing, but the Nine Tails need this whole area clear. That holds true even for allies like you.
PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Deny_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeySorryAbout=Hey, sorry about this, but the Nine Tails don't want anyone flying out here, even you. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Deny_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_HeyHowsIt=Hey, how's it going? We're crazy busy out here since the Nine Tails got something big going down. That's why I have to ask you to head back out. It's not safe for you to stick around.
PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Deny_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_SoHeresThe=So here's the deal. I know you're a friend of the Nine Tails and everything, but we really can't risk anybody getting in the way out here and messing things up. I'd appreciate it if you'd get out of here before there's an issue.
PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Deny_aNeutral_tPlayer_FromNeutral_IG_001_AttentionPilotThis=Attention, pilot. This here is Nine Tails' turf. Turn around and leave now or we will be forced to take action.
PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Deny_aNeutral_tPlayer_FromNeutral_IG_002_AllRightHere=All right, here's how it going to go. You leave and you live, you stay and you die. The choice is yours.
PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Deny_aNeutral_tPlayer_FromNeutral_IG_003_HeyImA=Hey. I'm a Nine Tails, so you better listen. You need to leave right now, okay? Or there's going to be trouble.

PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_EasyIsland_IG_001_ThesePlatformsAre=These platforms are Nine Tails territory now. We control the skies and we control the ground. I mean I knew it was only a matter of time before they sent someone in to try and take these back, but I really thought Crusader would at least try themselves before begging rando civilians to throw away their lives instead of risking their own. Anyway, I'm gonna tell you what I told them. I got people on every platform who are more than capable of handling some weekend warrior CDF scags like you. I'll give you one chance to get back on that shuttle, otherwise you're fair game.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_EasyIsland_IG_002_WhyTheHell=Why the hell do the CDF have to come in and wreck some good old-fashioned chaos? I mean, we're not messing with you, so why the hell do you wanna risk your life for those chickenshits at Crusader who don't even have the sack to defend their own territory? Take a second and think it over, we can blast any ship that comes near us out of the sky. I've got heavy-hitters locking down each of the platforms. You don't stand a chance, so just take my advice; get back on the shuttle, go home, and pop a Pips. You'll live longer.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_EasyIsland_IG_003_CrusadersEvenMore=Crusader's even more pathetic than we thought to rely on civvies to save their ass. We control the skies around all these platforms so there ain't nobody getting close that ain't a friend of Nine Tails and each island is controlled by someone you really don't want to be messing with, so best thing you can do is get back on that shuttle. It ain't your problem.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_FirstThresh_IG_001_YouProbablyThink=You probably think you're making good progress so far. And yeah, maybe we started off underestimating you, but don't worry, that'll change.

PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_LastThresh_IG_001_WhyTheHell=Why the hell won't you just die already? No bloody way am I'm losing to you CDF shitheads.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_LastThresh_IG_002_WhyWontYou=Why won't you all just walk away? You're acting like Crusader is someone worth protecting. Hell with it, we got something special cooked up for you.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_LastThresh_IG_003_GoddammitYouVolunteers=Goddammit! You volunteers couldn't just keep out of our business, could you? I got better things to do than deal with your stupid ass.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_MidThresh_IG_001_YouDontReally=You don't really think you're going to make a difference here, do you? Trust me, we're still in control here.

PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Intro_MissionBoss_IG_003_SoThisIs=So this is it, eh? Just me against an army of some over-eager volunteering do-gooders. Fine. It's time I got my hands bloody. I'll be waiting for you on the barge. Better bring your A-game.

PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Intro_MissionObj_ToLT_HardIsland_IG_003_GetYourGame=Get your game face on, Acker. You got some company.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Intro_MissionObj_ToLT_MedIsland_IG_001_NowYouGotta=Now you gotta deal with Scorch. You all right with that, Scorch?
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Intro_MissionObj_ToLT_MedIsland_IG_002_HeyScorchGot=Hey Scorch. Got some more kindling for you to burn.

PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Intro_MissionObj_ToLT_VeryHardIsland_IG_003_YoureOnDeck=You're on deck, Stax. Watch out for this one, okay?
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Succeed_MissionObj_EasyIsland_IG_001_SolankiWasRemys=Solanki was Remy's first real assignment and to be honest, I hoped he'd at least be able to hold his own against some pissant volunteers, but I'll bitch him out about that when he regens. The CDF won't get that lucky again.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Succeed_MissionObj_EasyIsland_IG_002_YouMayHave=You may have taken out Remy, but he was a newby compared to what's coming, so don?t think it's gonna get any easier from here.

PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Succeed_MissionObj_HardIsland_IG_002_GottaSayIm=Gotta say, I'm a little surprised you all managed to take out Acker. I mean, the guy was a certifiable lunatic. He made Vanduul seem tame, so it's probably better for all of us that he's out of the picture.
