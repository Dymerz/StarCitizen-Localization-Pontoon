PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_CheckpointTaken_NearTie_IG_002,P=Ooo, we got ourselves a real competition today. Don't know who's gonna snatch the prize.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_CheckpointTaken_NearTie_IG_003,P=I tell you what. This is it right here. This is the kind of race you dream about. Whoever wins is really earning their keep, today.

PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_EncourageLosingRacer_IG_001,P=This race isn't over yet. Doesn't matter what place you are right now. One lucky break or stupid mistake and this race is up for grabs, so stay in it.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_EncourageLosingRacer_IG_002,P=Now, if you're thinking about giving up hope just cause you're losing right now, let me remind you, the only thing separating you from victory is a handful of well-placed missiles. Think on it.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_EncourageLosingRacer_IG_003,P=As much as I love watching a skilled pilot win, I love a good underdog story even more. So know that even though you might be at the back of the pack right now, I'm pulling for you.

PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_GenCommentary_IntenseCombat_IG_003,P=Now, I'm not one to judge, but it feels like there are a lot of aggression issues being worked out right now.

PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_NonRacersInterrupt_IG_002,P=Seems we've got some uninvited guests screwing up our race.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_NonRacersInterrupt_IG_003,P=Heads up racers, looks like some blinders have decided to use you for target practice.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_OneRacerLeft_IG_001,P=Well, if I'm doing my math right, there's only one pilot left. So as long as they don't blow themselves up, the race is theirs.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_OneRacerLeft_IG_002,P=With only one survivor left, the finish is theirs for the taking. Piece of advice, don't get cocky. I've seen some crazy shit happen when people drop their guard.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_OneRacerLeft_IG_003,P=All right, we got good news and bad news. Good news for our last remaining pilot, you're all that's left, so you pretty much won. Bad news for everyone else who enjoys exciting races because... well see the good news. Someone wake me when they finish.

PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_Leader_IG_001,P=[ Laughing ] Oh, damn. I bet they thought they were gonna win.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_Leader_IG_002,P=Oh! They thought they were on top! That they were untouchable, but that dream came crashing down.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_Leader_IG_003,P=One second they're in the lead, and the next they're a flaming wreck. That's life for ya.

PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_NewLeaderKillsLeader_IG_002,P=Cycle of life here, people. It's all about killing your way to the top.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_NewLeaderKillsLeader_IG_003,P=Not only did that racer just kill their way into first place, but they did it with serious style.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerLeaves_IG_001,P=Um... a pilot just left in the middle of the race. What's the point of starting something you ain't gonna finish?
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerLeaves_IG_002,P=One of our racers just up and quit... That's a bit dissapointing.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerLeaves_IG_003,P=Seems one of our pilots ran away. Hope no one was betting on them.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerLeaves_IG_004,P=Did y'all see that pilot leave? Thought it went without saying, but don't leave in the middle of a race.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_First_IG_001,P=First checkpoint down. Let's see if they can make it two.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_First_IG_002,P=First one's down. We're off, people.

PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_003,P=Whew! Don't know about you but I am wiped. Before I head out, a shout out to our new champ and a big thanks to everyone else for making them look so damn good. This is Nas Calloway. I'll see y'all at the next one.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_004,P=That's it for me. Win or lose, hope you all had as much fun as I did. Though I'm guessing it's a lot more fun if you win. If you come back and race again, maybe you'll get to find out for yourself. 'Til then, keep it tight.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_005,P=Let me be the first to say congrats to our victor. And to all the others, hopefully, I'll see you all back here again real soon. It's been a trip.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_EntrantLeaves_IG_001,P=Seems one of our racers had a change of heart and ghosted. But hey, there's always other fish in the sea, right?
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_EntrantLeaves_IG_002,P=Well, we're down a entrant now. Guess some people can't handle the pressure. Screw it. Race's probably better off without 'em, anyway.

PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_RaceCanceled_IG_002,P=Alright, look. I hate to do it, but I got a bunch of pilots who bailed, so it looks like we're gonna have to race some other time.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_StartEarly_IG_001,P=Actually, I might kick this off a little early.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_StartEarly_IG_002,P=I'll be honest, I'm kinda eager to get this show on the road.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_StartEarly_IG_003,P=It's looking like we might be all set to go. Just gonna do a last count...
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_WaitLonger_IG_001,P=Stay frosty, y'all. Shouldn't be too much longer now.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_WaitLonger_IG_002,P=Just a couple more ticks, and we'll be ready to go.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_WaitLonger_IG_003,P=I know y'all wanna get this poppin' but it's gonna be a little bit longer.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_Welcome_LongWait_IG_001,P=Welcome, welcome. We're still waiting on a few more stragglers, so hang out for a sec. We'll get going soon.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_Welcome_LongWait_IG_002,P=Hey there, rambler. Welcome to the heat. Bet you're itching to get started, but I'm gonna need you to just sit tight 'til the rest of the racers show.

PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DataRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_AllRightSo=All right, so here's the deal. Got word that a facility is gonna be getting timed intelligence drops from their mainframe. You get ahold of these parcels, you can offload them to any number of infoagents in the area. Just watch your back though, you aren't the only person who's been interested in this.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DataRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ItsRutoThanks=It's Ruto. Thanks for the payment. I sent the details to your mobi, but the more you know, right? Anyway, location I sent you is the site of timed data drops. If you secure the server and get ahold of this intel, you can sell it off. The more you get, the more you can make. I know other fixers are selling this tip, so expect company.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DataRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. So here's the deal, the location I sent you is a server that's scheduled to start doing timed data drops. Now, I'm told that the site will be empty until much later, so you've got plenty of time to get in there and secure as many of these drops as you can. Just keep an eye out, you're not the only person I sold this info to.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereGot=Hey there. Got your payment. I sent you the details but here's the deal, a runner I know confided in me before he ran out of breath about a production lab that's set to start processing some drugs. The thing's fully automated and left alone, so anything that comes out's ripe for the taking. Now, I'm not sure how many other people may know about this, so you'll need to move quick and grab what you can.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ThanksForThe=Thanks for the creds, so I'm gonna deliver on my end. Got word that a drug lab's gonna start spitting out packages and there's no one there to watch it which pretty much sounds like a free-for-all to me. You got the location so have at it. Whatever you can get out of there with is yours. You can burn it, sell it, dump it into the sun for all I care.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_IJustSent=I just sent you the location of a drug lab that's about to turn into a goldmine. Whoever runs the place just started production on a slew of drug packages and left the place unguarded. I'm not gonna lie, it'll probably be a bloodbath, but you can offload whatever drugs you manage to score. Have fun.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. Looks like Crusader found the main Nine Tails fleet. I need you to go and keep those security and mercs off them until the Nine Tails finish up whatever the hell it is they're doing.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_WhyHelloThere=Why hello there. Ruto here. So here's the deal, Crusader ended up cracking the location of the Nine Tails fleet. They still have some shit they're trying to do, so I need you to tie up those Cru Sec pukes and their mercenary flunkies for as long as possible until the Nine Tails finish up.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_WhatsUpKiller=What's up, killer. It's Ruto. Thanks for lending a hand. In case you're totally in the dark, and don't read your contracts, Crusader Security have dispatched a bunch of mercs to where the Nine Tails are broadcasting their quantum dampening field from. I need you to hold them off until the Nine Tails finish up whatever the hell it is they're doing and get out of there.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. So here's the deal, Nine Tails is currently running their little quantum blockade thing which is causing all sorts of chaos for me. You see, Crusader's sending out scanning ships to try and find Nine Tails, but they're getting uncomfortably close to uncovering my operations. In short, I want you to track down the Crusader scanning ships and take them out.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereNine=Ruto here. Nine Tails are desperate to keep this quantum blockade up for a while longer. Crusader's sent in a bunch of scanning ships to flush them out, but I'm a little worried they're gonna blow up some of my spots, so I'm gonna need you to stop that. Take out as many scanning ships as you can.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HiThereIts=Hi there. It's Ruto. So here's the deal, Crusader scanning ships are out there trying to blow up the Nine Tails' little quantum blockade, but unfortunately they might stumble across some of my operations. That, I can't have, so get in there and take out as many of them as you can. Have fun, tiger.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_MedRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyRutoHere=Hey, Ruto here. So I got word that a medlab's going to be producing some packages of medicine at regular intervals for a limited time. If you can secure the area, grab whatever packages you can, and get out, then you can sell it any number of places. Watch out though. From what I gather, this isn't exactly classified information.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_MedRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ItsRutoGot=It's Ruto. Got your payment, so I figured I'd give you the platinum service. Here's the deal, contact of mine said a production facility's going to be churning out some medicine. You should watch out though. With a premium on this kind of medicine, you can be sure that other people will be trying to boost it.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_MedRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. So here's the deal, the data I sent you is the location of an automated production facility that's about to start churning out batches of medicine. You get there and secure it, all the batches that come out are yours for the taking. I've been hearing rumbles that this isn't exactly proprietary knowledge, so expect some company.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_WhyHelloThere=Why, hello there. I sent the details to your mobi, but here's the jist. That location's gonna temporarily turn into a hotspot. If you get in and get out, there's real money to be made, just watch your back in there.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereGot=Ruto here. Got your payment. Everything you need to know is in the message I sent you. You've only got a limited time to get there and secure the site before there isn't anything left to steal, but understand, you'll probably have some competition, so good luck.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_ItsRutoGot=It's Ruto. Got your credits. You should have all the details, but figured I'd give you a head's up. This is only going to last for a little while, so make sure you head out sooner rather than later. Just got word that some other fixers have been selling this info, so you'll probably have some company.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_ItsRutoYou=It's Ruto. You should have all the info you need to get going. Just wanted to let you know about a couple things: a) whatever you're able to steal, there are people out there looking to buy. B) This is only going to last for a little while. Lastly, you're probably gonna have some competition out there, so make sure you're armed.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_HeyThereRuto=Hey there. Ruto here. I sent you all the intel to knock out this job, but thought you should know. People have been selling info about this job to other operators, so you're most likely gonna have some company down there. I'd head down there sooner rather than later and secure the site. That bit of advice is free.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_BlackMarket_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyRutoHere=Hey, Ruto here. If you're looking for a spot to offload the stuff, I got word that a contact on the Black Market's paying primo creds for it. Something to consider.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_BlackMarket_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_WhatsUpIts=What's up. It's Ruto. Not sure if you've already got a buyer in mind, but if you don't, I happen to know someone on the black market who's paying a premium for any stuff you swipe. I'll send the details. That tip's on me.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_GrimHEX_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyItsMe=Hey, it's me again. Not sure if you've boosted anything yet, but I just got word that there's a very motivated buyer on Grim HEX who'll paying way over market value. That tip's free.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereKiller=Hey there, killer. FYI, I happen to know someone who's very eager to get their hands on any product from that site. It's your call, of course, I'm just a humble fixer, looking to establish meaningful financial relationships. You've got the details. Do with them what you will.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereJust=Ruto here.

PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_SoListenIm=So listen? I'm not sure if you've already got a plan for any stuff you boost, but if you're looking, I have a contact who's paying top creds for the stuff. I'll send you the location details... this is Ruto, by the way.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveFail_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_YouReallyGotta=You really gotta finish what you start. Even letting one of those scan ships survive just means that Crusader's that much closer to finding the Nine Tails.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveFail_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereIll=Ruto here. I'll admit, I was a little bummed out you weren't able to take out all those Crusader ships. To be fair, they only learned more info about Nine Tails, not me, so I wasn't that bothered, but still? it's sad.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveFail_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_UhOhLooks=Uh oh. Looks like those scan ships were able to get more intel about the location of the Nine Tails fleet. Sucks for them?
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveSuccess_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_RutoHereCan=Ruto here. Can I just say, it's awesome seeing your handiwork when you're on. Crusader's gonna have a helluva time trying to find the Nine Tails when all their ships are vented. Keep it up.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveSuccess_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_NiceJobBlasting=Nice job blasting all those scan ships. I'll be sure to let the Nine Tails know you're keeping Crusader off their tail. Or tails.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveSuccess_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_IReallyLove=I really love this spirit of unlawful camaraderie. Even though I'm in the clear, here you are, waxing Crusader security pukes to help keep them off the Nine Tails. It's really? it's really something?
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_RutoHereI=Ruto here. I just got word that my buyer closed up shop. Maybe next time, huh?
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyBadNews=Hey, bad news. My buyer's not taking anymore merch.
