RetrieveDatapad_Engineer_Journal=To: Captain Arliss Knox\nFrom: Judy Ramirez\nSubject: Grav Gen Issues\n\nHey Cap,\n\nBad news. That last little scuffle did more damage than I thought. The gravity generator's going to need a complete overhaul to get it working again, and that means we need to park up in a garage for a few days. \n\nSince I know we’re not going to do that until this job's done, and there’s a good chance the gravity's going to keep fritzing out on us which is less than ideal, so in the meanwhile, I went ahead and rigged the engineering console to allow anybody to do a hard reset of the system if they need to.\n\nFigure at least this way if I'm gunked up patching another part of the ship you all don't have to wait for me.\n\n-Judy\n

They pulled off the job no problem, but the bastard of a captain comm'd me demanding more credits. Turns out it wasn't the first time he's tried to pull this trick either because in middle of "negotiating" with me, his ship was attacked by some very pissed off individuals looking to teach him a lesson.\n\nOur comm got cut off when the shooting started and that was the last I heard from him. I'm guessing he's as good as ghosted, but I want you to head to the Pride of Arliss and try to get my data off the captain's personal datapad.\n\nOnce you have it, I set up a secure transmission channel at the ARC-L1 rest stop. Travel there and when you're in range, submit the data to me through this contract to get paid.\n  \nDon’t try to screw me over either. Karma can be a real asshole.\n

Ruto_Allies=Nine Tails
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_E_Desc=Here's the deal. ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) need to die at the same time. Unfortunately, they aren't gonna be in the same place.\n\nA double hit can sound complicated, but if you hire some additional guns it shouldn't be all that hard to do two hits simultaneously.\n\nMake sure you find folks who have skills as I have it on good authority that each'll be flying with some escorts for "protection." 
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_E_Title=together forever
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_H_Desc=Have another pair that needs simultaneous deathing. Seems to be getting more and more popular as a murder option. \n\nThis time it's ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2). Both are supposed to be pretty skilled operators and they won't be flying alone. \n\nI'd make sure whoever you get to help you on this one can handle a fight. 
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_H_Title=twice the headache
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_Intro_Desc=Guess what ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) have in common? \n\nYou're gonna kill 'em both!\n\nDifficult part is that I need you to kill them at the same time so that one doesn't have a chance to escape, or worse, kill the person trying to kill them. \n\nSo put together a team to track one target while you handle the other. Divide and conquer!\n\nAnd despite the fact they made a mess big enough to get themselves killed, my understanding is that they are relative lightweights. Don't expect you to meet too much resistance.
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_Intro_Title=simultaneous release
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_M_Desc=I really hope that you're not buddies with ~mission(TargetName) or ~mission(TargetName2) because I need you to ghost the pair of them... at the same time...\n\nOf course they wouldn't make this easy on us and travel in the same ship or something obvious like that. No. You're going to have to put together a crew so that you can down both targets simultaneously. \n\nAs soon as one of them is dead, be ready to drop the other one too. Can't risk either of them getting away.\n\nAnd I figure I should mention that not only are both pretty good pilots, but that they'll be traveling with backup too. Nothing you can't handle I'm sure.
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_M_Title=friends to the end
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_S_Desc=If you had asked me, I would've said ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) would have wound up eventually killing each other. But instead you're going to get the honor of killing them both at the same time.\n\nYou're going to have to work for it, though.\n\nEach one is trouble. Serious records, highly trained, and too smart to fly without backup.\n\nGather the best crew you can on this one. You'll need it. And don't be stingy. You can't spend credits if you're dead.
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_S_Title=double trouble
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_VE_Desc=It's pretty touching when you run across a pair that's willing to die for one another. Stupid but touching.\n\n~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) chose to stand by each other and now its gone and got them dead.\n\nFind a friend of your own and hunt each of these two down. Make sure you kill them at the same time. Call it poetic justice.\n\nThey should die pretty easy. Maybe they'll have a ship or two with them but I don't think it'll be anything to worry about. 
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_VE_Title=death do us part
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_VH_Desc=~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2). I think they may be related? Or dating? Doesn't really matter, someone wants them killed. \n\nI've arranged it so that you can hit them when they're not flying together. Safer for you this way. They are both serious business and fly with equally serious backup.\n\nMake sure you and your crew time your attacks. I don't want one of them left alive or it's going to be a real headache.
