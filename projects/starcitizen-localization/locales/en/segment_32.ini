PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Announce_GeneralInfo_IG_003_DidYouDiscover=Did you discover the craft of your dreams at this year's IAE? Then why not experience it first hand with a test flight? Many of the vehicles on display at this year's IAE are available to rent from one of our local providers.

PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_BestInShow_IG_001_SelectedByPopular=Selected by popular vote, the IAE Best in Show line up is a chance for your favorite ships to take center stage at the expo. At least most of the time. At the 2938 Expo, that year's winners were all ships too large to actually fit inside the show hall!
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_PilotsIntro_IG_001_WhileItMay=While it may be commonplace to sail through the stars, we should never lose sight of the wonders of space flight from discovering new jump points, unearthing lost ruins, or setting new speed records.

PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_Ship_MISCOdyssey_IG_001_MISCsLatestAddition=MISC's latest addition to their already impressive line of ships perfectly encapsulates the spirit of this year's IAE. Push the boundaries of the known universe with their new multi-crew wayfarer ship, the Odyssey. Get a sneak peek in the holoviewer room. Only at the IAE.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_AEGS_IG_001_FewCompaniesHave=Few companies have had as tumultuous a history as Aegis Dynamics. From its earliest days manufacturing iconic warships of the First Tevarin War through the darkest days of the Messer regime, Aegis ships have found a resurgence in the public eye for their versatility and robust construction.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_AEGS_IG_002_NoShipManufacturer=No ship manufacturer personifies this year's theme better than Aegis Dynamics. Whether you're running cargo in a Retaliator or providing security in a Gladius, Aegis ships are putting in work in every corner of the 'verse. Regardless of the controversies that have plagued them over the centuries, pilots continue to trust their lives and livelihood to their tried and true designs.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ANVL_IG_001_AnvilAerospaceMay=Anvil Aerospace may have made a name for itself along the frontlines with its masterfully built fleet of military craft, but more and more of the company's civilian craft have captured the imagination of the Empire. Look no further than the Anvil Carrack to see a ship that has transitioned easily from its Naval origins to the very edges of space as pilots use the ship to chart new territory.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ANVL_IG_002_AsTheWar=As the war against the Vanduul continues, many pilots find themselves seeking a way to protect their home and loved ones during these uncertain times. Anvil Aerospace has been a strong ally in this endeavor, creating civilian versions of their popular military craft, like the Hornet F7-C, to protect you and the ones you care about.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ARGO_IG_001_ContraryToPopular=Contrary to popular belief, Argo Astronautics name doesn't come from the ancient water craft of Earth mythology, but rather is derived from the initials of the company's founder Alana Redmond and is attributed to her mother.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_BANU_IG_001_ItsNotUncommon=It's not uncommon for Human manufacturers to offer unique features and designs to make their ships stand out from the crowd, but the Banu take a slightly different approach when it comes to crafting their vehicles. Heavily and freely borrowing from each other and even other species, Banu ships are made by combining the best features and best technology that they can get their hands on.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_CNOU_IG_001_OneOfThe=One of the newer ship manufacturers to debut at the IAE, Consolidated Outlands has already made its mark on the Expo when it introduced the first ever mobile construction yard in 2947. The Pioneer opened up exciting opportunities for planetary settlement by allowing settlers to create their own modular structures, and forever changing the idea of what a spacecraft could do.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_CRUS_IG_001_CrusaderIndustriesContinues=Crusader Industries continues to surprise ship enthusiasts around the empire. Initially known for their commercial transports like the Genesis Starliner and the Hercules StarLifter, Crusader has been expanding into the civilian market with the introduction of their Ares Star Fighter and Mercury Star Runner. Needless to say, the future is bright for this titan of astro-engineering.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_CRUS_IG_002_UnlikeManyOf=Unlike many of their competitors, Crusader Industries dedicates as much effort on their employees as they do on their products. Recognized as one of the UEE's best employers in 2943 and 2946, Crusader not only offers competitive pay and benefit programs to all employees, but also houses extensive in-house  training and education programs to foster talent and take their workers to the next level of their career.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_DRAK_IG_001_MentionTheName=Mention the name Drake Interplanetary in a room and you're sure to kick off some debate. To some, they're villains, arming the most dangerous elements in the 'verse with the tools to wreak havoc. But did you know that this criminal connection was only made possible because Drake ships were so common? In the infamous Kesselring Heist of 2903, a Drake caterpillar was used specifically because it was easy to blend in with the masses in flight.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_DRAK_IG_002_NoOneBrings=No one brings the thunder to IAE quite like Drake Interplanetary. Love 'em or hate 'em, their ships have become versatile and affordable options for everyone from security and militia forces to haulers trying to scrape a living out in the black. The Drake Red medic ship was recently recognized for the 'most lives saved' thanks to the ship's usage in medstations and hospitals around the UEE.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ESPR_IG_001_ThoughTheExpo=Though the Expo attracts the latest innovations and technological wonders, Esperia is constantly paving the way forward with their reverence of the past. Preserving important historical craft and xeno-vehicles, Esperia defines spaceflight in entirely new ways by providing unique experiences that would otherwise be unavailable to modern pilots.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_GRIN_IG_001_GreycatIndustrialHolds=Greycat Industrial holds the distinction of having the most ever vehicles at a single IAE when in 2926 a thousand buggy parade was driven through the streets of Severus. The highlight was when all of the buggy's sounded their horns together to play a rendition of the Imperial anthem.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_MISC_IG_001_ItsCommonKnowledge=It's common knowledge that MISC builds some of the hardest working ships around, but to get that tough a lot of thought and careful consideration had to go into even the smallest of details. To find the best panel adhesive, MISC ran over a million thermocycle shock tests at their R&D center. The winner alone was able to survive tens of thousands of cycles without failing. Talk about being built to last.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_MISC_IG_002_RepresentedInAlmost=Represented in almost every industry, MISC continues to create reliable, durable, and versatile ships at a variety of pricepoints. One of their toughest tests is known affectionately as the "Meat Grinder." Though the specifics of the test are a proprietary secret, insiders claim that the test aims to inundate the prototype ship with nearly three dozen adverse conditions, sometimes attacking with three to four at the same time in an effort to prove that their ship can survive the harshest of the harsh conditions.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ORIG_IG_001_LuxuryElegancePerformance=Luxury. Elegance. Performance. These are only a handful of the terms that are regularly associated with Origin Jumpworks ships. Since the 28th century, Origin has consistently pushed the boundaries of speed and sophistication, but did you know that their controversial decision to uproot their headquarters from Earth to Terra in 2913 nearly sank the company?
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ORIG_IG_002_PerpetuallyExpandingWhats=Perpetually expanding what's possible when it comes to high-end performance vehicles, Origin Jumpworks is a fan favorite at the IAE and this year's lineup is sure to impress. When attempting to design a new addition to their roster, Origin engineers have looked for inspiration from a variety of sources. For example, when initially brainstorming designs that would ultimately become the X1, Engineering Director Alberto Vara looked to musical notes to dictate the potential shape language of the open-canopy racer.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_RSI_IG_001_SomeHistoriansCredit=Some historians credit Roberts Space Industries with the invention of modern spaceflight. For founder Chris Roberts, the prospect of making space travel more accessible was a lifelong dream and when his company unveiled their prototype Quantum Core Engine in 2075, suddenly, space travel didn?t seem that fantastical anymore.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_RSI_IG_002_ItsPrettyAmazing=It's pretty amazing to think that RSI makes one of the smallest ships on the market and one of the biggest. It would take about 50 Auroras laid end to end to equal the length of one mighty Bengal carrier.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_XIAN_IG_001_XianShipsAre=Xi'an ships are becoming a more common sight across the UEE, but it wasn't too long ago that their sale was completely forbidden by the Xi'an Emperor.

PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecShip_AnvilSpartan_IG_001_DespiteTheAerospace=Despite the Aerospace in it's name, Anvil has hardly been limited to the skies.

PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecShip_CrusaderAres_IG_001_AlthoughCrusaderIndustries=Although Crusader Industries might be best known for their transports, their recent introduction of the Ares Star Fighter shows that the charity-minded manufacturer is taking a new approach to helping citizens across the Empire, and more specifically those who live on Crusader itself.

PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecShip_DrakeBuccaneer_IG_001_IntroducedIn2887=Introduced in 2887, Drake's Buccaneer almost begs its pilots to pick a fight.

PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_ThemeIntro_IG_001_TheThemeOf=The theme of this year's expo is "Dare to Fly" which celebrates the courage of pilots everywhere who boldly take flight to discover new thrills, to seek adventure, and to push boundaries farther than ever imagined.

PU_JTVOGUIDE01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_BriefingRoom_IG_001_HelloAndWelcome=Hello and welcome to the UEES War Hammer. This Javelin-Class destroyer was originally built by Aegis Dynamics and has been in active service since 2832. Launching under the command of Captain Omar Singh, the ship initially served as a combat support vessel in the 2nd Fleet, 6th Battle Group. A posting that put it close to the Vanduul front. The War Hammer saw action during the Fall of Caliban in 2884 where it protected retreating civilian and Naval forces when the system ultimately fell, earning a ribbon for Valor in the process. For the next several decades, the War Hammer transitioned between fleets in a variety of support and patrol positions, even participating in the UEE push to reclaim the Nexus system in the 2930's. Most recently, the War Hammer distinguished itself as the primary combat vessel to repel the outlaw group known as XenoThreat from the Stanton system. Since then, the War Hammer has been placed in drydock for repairs, but is heading back to active service once this year's Invictus festivities are concluded.\n\nThe room you're currently seated in is the main briefing room for the entire ship. Based around a holovolume built by microTech, the crew gathers here to discuss everything from battle strategies to repair schedules. The Marine detail assigned to this ship also uses this room to plan out their boarding actions or outline combat strategies. This room has even acted as a venue for off-duty activities such as vid screenings or sporting event parties.\n\nWe hope that you'll take the opportunity to explore the ship and get an up close look at one of the vanguards of order. On behalf of Captain Medcalf and the rest of the crew, I want to wish you a fantastic Invictus and hope we see you next year.
