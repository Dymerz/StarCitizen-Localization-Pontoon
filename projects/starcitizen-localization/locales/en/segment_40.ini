TarPits_ShipStrip_desc_001=Got a particular salvage job that we could use some extra hands on. \n\nWe need you to find a ~mission(ship) that got punched out around ~mission(location). Security’s already searching for it and if they find it, they’ll ID it for sure and we’ll be in loads of trouble.\n\nSo, we want you to scrape it clean before anybody else gets eyes on it. Rip the entire hull off so nobody can tell who it belonged to, don’t leave a speck of paint, and obviously keep your mouth shut about anything you see. \n\nWe’ll cred you up and anything you scrap is yours to keep. But if security finds the ship before you’re done, we’ll all be screwed and you won’t get paid so don’t disappoint.
TarPits_ShipStrip_title_001=~mission(ship) clean up
TarPits_TimedSalvage_Desc_01=We’ve got our eye on a ~mission(ship) near ~mission(location) that’s ripe for salvaging. We’re too busy to snag it ourselves, so why not spread the wealth, right?\n\nIf you send us some credits, we’ll send you the ship’s exact coordinates. Don’t take too long to think it over, though. You’ve probably got about ~mission(timer) minutes until security gets there to check out the wreck. Could be more, could be less.\n\nIf you’re fast enough, you can get in, get your haul, and get out without a shot fired. Not a bad deal, right? And once you've salvaged everything you want, just go ahead and abandon this contract to clear your map. Helps keep everything nice and tidy.
TarPits_TimedSalvage_Desc_02_ChickenShip=We got word that Adagio has a salvage contract coming for a ~mission(ship). If you’re interested in swooping in, we can sell you the coordinates for a nice discount. Gotta decide fast, though.\n\nSome unlucky salvager will probably buy the rights to the claim soon, but our guess is that it’ll take at least ~mission(timer) minutes until they get there. If they see you picking at their claim, they might call security on you but if you’re any good you should have plenty of time. And if you’re slow, I guess you can just shoot them down before they send word to anyone, right?
TarPits_TimedSalvage_Title_01=Risky ~mission(Ship) Salvage Job

Tut01_Journal01_GettingStarted_Content=Welcome to Star Citizen!\n\nYou have just stepped 930 years into a future where Humanity has spread across the stars under the rule of the United Empire of Earth (the UEE). While many Humans spend their lives never leaving their homeworld, there are those who choose to travel aboard advanced starships, braving outlaws, hostile aliens, and hazardous conditions to seek their fortune.  \n\nCurrently, you are in Area18, on ArcCorp, the third planet in the Stanton System – a great distance from Humanity’s origins in the Sol System. The four planets in the system are owned by megacorporations who each purchased a planet from the UEE and now govern their own region of space. They are: Hurston Dynamics, Crusader Industries, ArcCorp, and microTech. \n\nArea18 is the main commercial zone of the mega-city that sprawls across the surface of ArcCorp. From here, the tutorial will guide you to Baijini Point, the space station in orbit above the planet that can serve as your gateway to further exploration of the Stanton system.

Tut01_Journal02_TheBasics_Content=The universe of Star Citizen is a dynamic place, providing players with the ability to interact with much of the environment around them. The foundation of this ability is the game’s Interaction Mode. \n\nIf you are in range to interact with an object – like a door or item of food – it will be highlighted blue and a number of options will appear, defining the various ways you can interact with that item. The option you are currently selecting will be highlighted in a brighter color than the other options. \n\nYou can also Quick Interact with objects to do the main action associated with it. For example, Quick Interacting with a closed door will open it. It'll also pick up an item, loot a container, and switch lights on or off.\n\nYou can also use Interaction Mode to zoom in or zoom out on objects you’re looking at. When interacting with an interface, you can also scroll through the list of available options on the display. For example, you can scroll through the list of floor options while interacting with an elevator panel.\n\nFor all manners of interaction, you may prefer to use different keybinds. To view all the current keybinds or adjust them, use the Keybinding tab of the Options menu.

Tut02_Journal01_Trading_Content=The universe of Star Citizen has many unique pieces of equipment and clothing for you to use. These items may be looted from adversaries but can also be purchased from the numerous stores around the ‘verse. Specialized stores at major landing zones tend to have the necessary stock to cover your basic needs, whereas quieter areas might have unique variants or niche equipment.\n\nTo buy an item on display, approach it and enter Interaction Mode. The brand logo, item name, and price will be displayed, as well as options to BUY, TRY ON, or INSPECT the item. If you like what you see and have the necessary funds, selecting the BUY option will open your mobiGlas so you can complete the purchase.\n\nYou can also use Interaction Mode to browse the shopping kiosks. While these kiosks are not as hands-on, it is easier to buy goods in volume through the kiosk interfaces. Kiosks also give you the option to choose where the items will be delivered – either to your local storage or directly to your personal inventory.\n\nTo sell items, first make sure that they are in your personal inventory, local storage, or are cargo on a vehicle stored at that location. Then you can interact with a shopping kiosk at a store and use the “SELL” tab. From there you will be given options to select which items you wish to sell. Not all stores will purchase all items.\n\nPERSONAL INVENTORY\nYour Personal Inventory is the storage on your character. You can use this screen to arrange and organize your items, transferring them between your Personal Inventory and Local Storage or equipping them to your character. Take note that certain items have requirements for when they can be equipped, such as armor needing to be placed on an undersuit. All inventories have a capacity bar near the top that indicates how much they can store. \n\nLOCAL STORAGE\nYour Local Storage is unique to the current zone you are in. For example, if you are on microTech you will no longer have access to your Area18 storage. While Local Storages are significantly larger than Personal Inventories, they still have their own maximum capacity.\n\nAs you accumulate a high number of items, you can use the tabs at the top of the Local Inventory window to filter through specific categories of items and equipment.\n\nVehicles also have their own storage capacity. This inventory is not shared with any other players aboard and remains accessible to you while onboard the vehicle or while that vehicle is parked at your current landing zone.\n\nLOSING ITEMS\nRemember, when you get into dangerous situations out in the ‘verse you risk losing your items! Things in your personal inventory at the time of your death will remain on your corpse and will need to be retrieved. The same is true when a vehicle is destroyed. There is a chance that other players will find and claim your lost items before you can.\n\nAnything in storage at a major city landing zone is safe regardless of what happens to you or your vehicles.

Tut03_Part02_Journal01_ShipFlightBasics_Content=Congratulations!\n\nYou’ve completed the Star Citizen Tutorial and are ready to explore the universe! \n\nNow it’s up to you decide what your life in space will be like. The Contract Manager on your mobiGlas contains many different opportunities for you to pursue from simple delivery missions to dangerous criminal jobs. Work hard and you can build your reputation with different organizations to gain access to more rewarding contracts. Whether you choose to live a life of crime or hunt down bounties and enforce the law, it is up to you.\n\nHowever, if you’d rather forge your own path, feel free to use the StarMap in the mobiGlas and explore all the Stanton system has to offer. From the snowy wastelands of microTech to the floating city of Orison, there is still much for you to learn and discover. If you ever need further assistance, you can seek the guidance of experienced players through the Guide system on Spectrum (on the Roberts Space Industries website), read the helpful posts in the online Knowledge Base, or ask for a helping hand in chat. Your journal is also a valuable resource, containing entries that summarize and elaborate on everything covered in the tutorial.\n\nBut once you venture beyond the major cities and space stations, take care. Outside of these protected armistice zones you will encounter many dangers in the search for profit. Wherever your next steps take you, safe flying!\n\nPRACTICE MAKES PERFECT\nIf you’re interested in practicing flying or experiencing combat without risking your ship, Star Citizen features an arcade mode called ‘Arena Commander’ as an option in the game’s main menu.\n\nMOBIGLAS\nYour mobiGlas personal computer features a variety of functions and apps essential to life in the ‘verse.

Create a party, invite other players, or send friend requests here. You can also activate or deactivate proximity-based voice chat from this app.\n\nVehicle Loadout Manager – Customized the loadout, including components or paints, for any vehicle you own that are stored at your current local location. Components you wish to use must be in your local inventory.\n\nNikNax – Locate any assets you have stored across the 'verse. Selecting an asset will provide added details.\n\nSkyline – Access the StarMap set Quantum Travel routes by selecting a location and pressing the “Set As Destination” button. \n\nmo.Trader – Send aUEC to any player. Party members will be pinned to the top of the selection list.\n\nContracts Manager – View, accept, and manage contracts. The Contracts Manager is divided into the following tabs: General, Personal, Accepted, and History.\n• The General Tab displays local contracts certified to meet UEE and local law requirements. \n• The Personal Tab displays contracts sent specifically to your account, often from unknown sources that may violate local laws.\n• Once you accept an offer, contracts are moved to the Accepted Tab, and once a contract ends, either through successful completion or by other means, a record of it is kept in the History Tab.\n\nVehicle Maintenance Services – Repair, restock, and refuel your vehicles.\n\nJournal – A record of useful information and documents, including tutorial information.\n\nDelphi – Track your reputation with individual organizations or contacts.\n

Tut03_Part03_Hint10_Congratulations=You have completed the Star Citizen Tutorial and are ready to explore the ‘Verse.\n\nFor additional guidance, check your journal, the online knowledge base, or ask the community.
Tut03_Part03_Hint10_Congratulations_Title=Congratulations! 
Tut03_Part03_Journal01_TraversingtheVerse_Content=Congratulations!\n\nYou’ve completed the Star Citizen Tutorial and are ready to explore the universe! \n\nNow it’s up to you decide what your life in space will be like. The Contract Manager on your mobiGlas contains many different opportunities for you to pursue from simple delivery missions to dangerous criminal jobs. Work hard and you can build your reputation with different organizations to gain access to more rewarding contracts. Whether you choose to live a life of crime or hunt down bounties and enforce the law, it is up to you.\n\nHowever, if you’d rather forge your own path, feel free to use the StarMap in the mobiGlas and explore all the Stanton system has to offer. From the snowy wastelands of microTech to the floating city of Orison, there is still much for you to learn and discover. If you ever need further assistance, you can seek the guidance of experienced players through the Guide system on Spectrum (on the Roberts Space Industries website), read the helpful posts in the online Knowledge Base, or ask for a helping hand in chat. Your journal is also a valuable resource, containing entries that summarize and elaborate on everything covered in the tutorial.\n\nBut once you venture beyond the major cities and space stations, take care. Outside of these protected armistice zones you will encounter many dangers in the search for profit. \n\nWherever your next steps take you, safe flying!

Tutorial01_MissionDesc=Congratulations on taking your first steps into the universe!\n\nOver the course of this tutorial, you’ll learn how to get around both on foot and in space. \n\nFirst up is helping you familiarize yourself with some basic movement controls and the use of your mobiGlas while still inside your “Hab” (or habitation). Follow the objectives and hints on your HUD (heads-up display) to proceed through this mission.
Tutorial01_MissionTitle=Tutorial - Your First Steps
Tutorial02_MissionDesc=Well done!\n\nWith the first part behind you, you should now have some basic familiarity with the movement controls, managing your hunger and thirst, and some of the core functionality of your mobiGlas – namely the Contract Manager and your Journal.\n\nThis next section will help you familiarize yourself with Area18 and take you to visit Cubby Blast, a weapons store here in Area18.\n\nYou can shop there, and at other stores like it, using United Earth Credits (UEC). During the Alpha phase of Star Citizen’s development, we will be using a currency called aUEC (Alpha United Earth Credits). This is a temporary currency specifically designed for testing the in-game economy and balance.  
Tutorial02_MissionTitle=Tutorial - Your First Purchase
Tutorial03_MissionDesc=You’re almost through with the tutorial. All that remains is to take flight!\n\nWith your business in Area18 finished, it’s time to leave the city – and eventually the planet. Make your way through ArcCorp Plaza to the Cityflight transit shuttles. These shuttles can take you all around Area18 – but your destination is the spaceport, where an Anvil C8 Pisces has been temporarily provided for you.\n\nThis snub scouting ship is a great starter vessel, perfect for new pilots looking to get their wings.
