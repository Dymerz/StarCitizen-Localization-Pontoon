PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_RutoHereJust=Ruto here. Just heard my buyer closed up shop so you might need to offload your merch somewhere else.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_NotTakePart_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_ItsRutoSo=It's Ruto. So that thing we talked about? Yeah, it's over, so you missed it. Next time maybe?
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_NotTakePart_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. Seems like you lost interest in that little job I told you about, but the thing's over anyway. So? yeah? I guess you missed out.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_NotTakePart_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_ItsRutoWord=It's Ruto. Word is that the job I talked to you about earlier? Yeah, it's over. Maybe next time, huh? Oh, it probably goes without saying, but I don't do refunds.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyItsMe=Hey, it's me. Just got word that there aren't gonna be anymore drops. You can stick around if you want, but it'll just be for the fun of the kill.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereNot=Ruto here. Not sure if you're fighting anyone right now, but a contact said that the site isn't gonna be spitting out any more drops, so you might as well bail.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. Got a hit that there aren't gonna be any more drops from that site, so I'd get out of there and sell whatever you got.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyNineTails=Hey, Nine Tails are pulling out. Crusader and their mercs were causing too much damage. I'd lay low if I were you. They're pretty pissed.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ItsRutoLooks=It's Ruto. Looks like Crusader pushed out the Nine Tails. From what I hear, they're furious about losing their blockade. Anyway, expect things to get bloody.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. Nine Tails are pulling out of the area because of those security punks and their mercs. Apparently this whole blockade was a smokescreen for something else they were doing  and they didn't get to do it. Anyway, word just got back to me that they're fuming.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_RutoHereJust=Ruto here. Just got word that Crusader managed to lock down the location of the Nine Tails fleet, but in worse news, those assholes stumbled across one of my side hustles. Next time, when I tell you to blast scanning ships, you blast more scanning ships.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_WhatTheHell=What the hell? When I hire you, I expect you to do the job I hired you for. Now those Crusader security dipshits are all over the Nine Tails' fleet and messing up another one of my operations. Get your shit together? (Pause) This is Ruto.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_ItsRutoGotta=It's Ruto. Gotta say, I'm a little pissed you weren't able to take out those Crusader security idiots fast enough. Now a couple of my businesses have become little more public than I would like. They also figured out where the Nine Tails are broadcasting their quantum dampening from, so you basically screwed up on two fronts. Helluva job.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyLookWhen=Hey, look. When I said I need those scan ships destroyed, I didn't think I was being cryptic. Take this as a learning opportunity: get better. Or get lost.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereI=Ruto here. I hired you to do a job, so you better start doing it. I better hear about a whole graveyard of scan ships at the next scan point.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. I'm still trying to get my operations out of the line of fire, so stop letting those scan ships live. That is what I'm paying you for.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_YouGottaGet=You gotta get your head in gear and do the job I'm paying you to do. I need those scan ships dusted before they expose facets of my operation that I would prefer to remain hidden. That clear enough for you?
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_LetsTakeA=Let's take a moment and recognize that you are not holding up your end of the bargain here. I need those Crusader ships dusted before they finish their scans. Internalize that and don't screw up again.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Remind_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyJustWanted=Hey. Just wanted to remind you that my buyer's still looking to take whatever you stole off your hands. If you're interested?
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Remind_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereMy=Ruto here. My buyer's still paying out for any product you boosted.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Remind_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_ThisIsRuto=This is Ruto. Not sure if you forgot, but my buyer's still fiending to buy everything you stole. Make sure to hit 'em up.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Buyer_HighSales_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. My buyer dropped me a comm to say that you sold off a bunch of merch. Seems you made quite the score.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Buyer_HighSales_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ItsRutoJust=It's Ruto. Just got a really enthusiastic call from my buyer. Seems you made quite the impression.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Buyer_HighSales_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyRutoHere=Hey, Ruto here. Just heard you made a monster sale to my buyer. Make sure to buy yourself something nice.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereIts=Hey there. It's Ruto. Just heard you made some creds. Glad to see we could work something out.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereMy=Ruto here. My contact said you just dropped by and sold some stuff. I'm not expecting a tip, but you know? a little courtesy goes a long way.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_ItsRutoMy=It's Ruto. My buyer was real pleased with the merch your dropped off. Keep it up.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereChamp=Hey there, champ. Nine Tails finished whatever it is they were doing. Nice job keeping those Crusader hacks off their back.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HiyaItsRuto=Hiya. It's Ruto. Looks like Nine Tails are pulling out of the system. They're jazzed, so I guess their quantum blockade must have been a success. Score one for the good guys.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_WhosMyFavorite=Who's my favorite operator? Helluva job protecting that Nine Tails fleet. They took care of everything they needed to do and Crusader are left looking like a bunch of dopes. So a good day for everyone.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyRutoHere=Hey, Ruto here. Got some good news and bad news. Bad news is that those scanning ships seem to have found the Nine Tails fleet. Good news is you did a helluva job keeping Crusader off my back. So that's cool. Thanks.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ItsRutoMiss=It's Ruto. Miss me? Anyway, you did a great job distracting Crusader long enough for me to shuffle some of my operations around. So good job. Unfortunately, they also found the Nine Tails which is less cool, but hey, shit happens. Later.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_YouCopyIts=You copy? It's Ruto. Thanks for taking out those Crusader ships. I was able to make some moves to keep them from finding out some of my less hidden operations. On the flip side, I guess they dug out the location of the Nine Tails fleet, so that sucks?for them.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aPlayer_tEnemy_FromAlly_IG_001_RutoAgainHelluva=Ruto again. Helluva job burning those Crusader ships. Keep an eye out in case any more scanning ships show up.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aPlayer_tEnemy_FromAlly_IG_002_HiyaImBack=Hiya. I'm back. Heard you dusted a handful of those Cru Sec ships. I appreciate it. I assume Nine Tails are pleased as well. Anyway, keep an eye out for any new scanning ships arriving. (pause) This is Ruto, by the way.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aPlayer_tEnemy_FromAlly_IG_003_RutoHereJust=Ruto here. Just wanted to say you did a bang-up job dusting those security pukes. Make sure you do the same if Crusader sends out some replacements. Keeping them off of Nine Tails also keeps them off of me, which is pretty great. Later.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aPlayer_tEnemy_FromAlly_IG_004_RutoHereThanks=Ruto here. Thanks for wrecking those scan ships. Should definitely give me a little more time to make some moves. You should stick around in case any more show up or hunt down more of them. Both would be great. Later.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aPlayer_tEnemy_FromAlly_IG_005_HeyThereIts=Hey there. It's Ruto again. I like what you did to those Crusader security ships. Very efficient. Gonna help me loads to keep the law away from my little operation. I'm sure the Nine Tails will be thrilled too. Feel free to keep hunting down any more scan ships. Ruto out.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_EvadeDetection_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereIts=Hey there. It's Ruto. Just wanted to let you know, I made some moves, reshuffled some hustles, and got my business squared away. By all means, feel free to keep wiping out Crusader scan ships. I'm sure the Nine Tails would appreciate the help.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_EvadeDetection_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoAgainThanks=Ruto again. Thanks for holding off those Crusader dopes. My shit is now officially in order, so we're good. If you wanna keep blasting them, and who doesn't, keep doing what you're doing. Nine Tails still got their thing going on, so I'm sure they'll be all for it.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_EvadeDetection_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_MyHeroGreat=My hero. Great job distracting those Crusader ships long enough for me to reshuffle my operations. They can scan all they want now and they won't find anything. Of mine, at least. But hey, if you wanna keep killing scan ships, I'm sure the Nine Tails will dig it.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Warn_Buyer_Expiring_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HopeYoureEn=Hope you're en route to my buyer to offload that merch. I just got word that they aren't gonna be buying for too much longer.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Warn_Buyer_Expiring_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereFor=Ruto here for a quick sec. My buyer doesn't look like they're gonna be buying for too much longer, so if you got merch to sell, I'd hot-foot it over there.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Warn_Buyer_Expiring_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyaNotSure=Heya. Not sure if you've sold off the stuff you boosted, but if not, my buyer's not gonna be buying for that much longer.

PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Warn_Mission_Expiring_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereThat=Ruto here. That little job I talked to you about? It's almost over, so I'd head that way sooner rather than later if you're looking to get involved.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Warn_Mission_Expiring_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyThereRuto=Hey there. Ruto here. Just got word that the job I sent you is gonna end soon. Might want to hustle if you're still interested. Doesn't matter to me, I'm already paid.

PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_IG_004_ItsToughRight=It's tough, right? Should you buy right now? Should you take the risk and wait? I mean I know what I would do, but I want you to do what'll make you happy.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_IG_005_SoIsThis=So is this the one? I think it might be the one.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_UsedShip_IG_001_GottaSayBuying=Gotta say, buying used is really the way to go. Not only do you save on credits, but with the high-tech engineering that goes into these things, they run good as new for decades.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_UsedShip_IG_002_BuyingUsedReally=Buying used really is the smart way to go. Better on the environment, better on bank account, and way less stress. And more importantly, it's new to you.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_UsedShip_IG_003_YouWannaKnow=You wanna know the difference between a new and used ship? Leaving the dealership. Bam. Every ship instrantly becomes a used ship.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_Excuse_FromCustomer_IG_001_AnywayYouLook=Anyway, you look like someone who knows their ships. You don't need me talking your ear off. Do your thing, and I'll check on you in a bit.

PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_PlayerExitShipComment_IG_002_HowAboutThat=How about that detailing? It's something else.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_PlayerExitShipComment_IG_003_ImJustGonna=I'm just gonna say it. You two look good together.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_PlayerExitShipComment_IG_004_HardToSay=Hard to say what's better, right? That great exterior, or that real sharp interior.

PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Beautiful_IG_001_IKnowWhat=I know what you're thinking. How can a ship that looks that gorgeous cost so little? To be honest, I can't believe it myself.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Beautiful_IG_002_ThoseLinesThe=Those lines, the styling. Even sitting still she looks like she's flying. A real beauty.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Fast_IG_001_IfYouWanna=If you wanna talk fast, this speedster can hold her own. The throttle pretty much accelerates by itself.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Fast_IG_002_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking for speed, then you're looking in the right place. You should hear this baby purr when she gets going.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_GreatDeal_IG_001_AsGoodAs=As good as this ship is, it's hard to believe it's this cheap. But hey, if that's what the price says, that's what the price says.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_GreatDeal_IG_002_DependingOnWhich=Depending on which way you want to go, this ship is probably one of the best deals on the floor. Great condition. Great price.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_HardWorking_IG_001_WhatsGreatAbout=What's great about this one here is that it works just as hard as you do if not harder.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_HardWorking_IG_002_IfYouWant=If you want a ship that is going to be there day in, day out, taking what ever you throw at it, then this right here might be the ship you want.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_001_YouGotA=You got a good eye. That's some quality craftsmanship right there. They don't make 'em like this any more, I can tell you that.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_002_YouKnowI=You know, I shouldn't say this, but this right here might be my favorite in the whole place. Not that anything we sell isn't fantastic, but I don't know... there's just something special about her. You feel it, right?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_003_OkayPictureThis=Okay, picture this, you're traveling to see that special someone. What are you riding in, some random old junker? Or are you cruising along in a top of the line genuine certified pre-owned beauty like this one here?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_004_WeGetA=We get a lot of different vehicles coming and going, but every once in a while we get something in like this one here that really catches my eye.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_005_YouCanTalk=You can talk specs and figures all day, but sometimes when you look at a ship, you just know its right for you. I say trust that gut.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Safe_IG_001_PersonallyWhatI=Personally, what I look for in a ship, is something that can get me where I'm going safe and sound in one piece. That's gonna be this ship right here.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Safe_IG_002_TheySayYou=They say you can't put a price on safety. I say bullshit. Not only did we put a price on it, we put a great price on it. Protection per credit, you're not gonna find much better than this.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Strorage_IG_001_IDontKnow=I don't know about you, but I can always use some more storage room. That's why this ship is perfect. Plenty of SCU and then some.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Strorage_IG_002_IfStorageIs=If storage is important to you, then you should do yourself a favor and spend some time with this ship. I think you'll be happy with what you see.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_100Series_IG_001_YouKnowA=Not only is the 300 a pleasure to fly, when you're not flying her, she's a real pleasure to look at. I know I wouldn't kick her out of my hangar.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_300Series_IG_001_YouKnowThe=Promise me one thing, if you wind up getting the 600, you're gonna invite me to one of your parties cause everybody knows that the best parties in the verse are 600 parties.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_600Series_IG_001_PromiseMeOne=I'll be honest, I wasn't quite sure what to make of the 85x at first. But now that I've spent some time with her, she's really grown on me. It's got all of origin's attention to detail streamlined down to a smaller package.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_85X_IG_001_IllBeHonest=You know a lot of the younger people who come in here are interested in the 100. And I mean, why not? Origin comfort wrapped up in a sporty, fun chasis. I see the appeal myself.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_890Jump_IG_001_LookIllBe=Look. I'll be blunt. There's a swimming pool. If that doesn't convince you on the 890, I'm not sure what else will.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_ArgoMPUV_IG_001_TheArgoMpuv=The Argo MPUV is a great little workhorse. Functional to a fault.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Arrow_IG_001_IveTalkedTo=I've talked to some of the ex-Navy who come in here about the Arrow. Well, to tell the truth, it's more like they talk to me about it. Can't say enough good things. Seems the light fighter makes one hell of a scout ship. Not many serving who haven't had their butt saved by one of these guys.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Aurora_IG_001_ConsideringAnAurora=Considering an Aurora, huh? I like that. People are so eager to over complicate things that they forget that basic doesn't mean bad. The Aurora flies and gets you where you're going. Sounds like the perfect ship to me.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Avenger_IG_001_TheresAReason=There's a reason the Advocacy's been counting on Avengers for so long. Few ships can match its operational flexibility. The thing's an icon.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Blade_IG_001_ShesAKiller=She's a killer, isn't she? It's like the Vanduul took a Scythe and shaved it down till all that was left was the bite.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Buccaneer_IG_001_TheBuccsA=The Bucc's a great little fighter. You toss one into any scrap and suddenly its a whole new game. Cutlass coming at you, you can handle it. Cutlass and a Bucc, forget about it.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Carrack_IG_001_ICouldPretty=I could pretty much talk all day about the Carrack, but I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna let the ship speak for itself.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Caterpillar_IG_001_CaterpillarsGotA=Caterpillar's got a ton of storage, and Drake was thoughtful enough to give it few ways to protect it. Plus, I always get a weird thrill when a ship looks like its name.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Constellation_IG_001_EveryoneLovesTo=Everyone loves to argue which Connie is the best, but that's like arguing what amount of free money is the best. What I'm trying to say is that they're such a fantastic ship, you really can't go wrong with whichever one you fly.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Crucible_IG_001_TheCrucibleIs=The Crucible is some pretty incredible engineering. Thing is basically a flying toolbox. They can fix up most problems a pilot can run into. If that's not a great skill to have, don't know what is.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Cutlass_IG_001_SolidOffenseDecent=Solid offense, decent defense, not too shabby of a hold, easy to take care of, and an interesting reputation to say the least. A lot of people think the Cutlass is a great investment, and I'm tempted to agree.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Cyclone_IG_001_TheNewTumbril=The new Tumbril really outdid themselves with the Cyclone. I had an old homesteader in just the other week telling me that she had been riding in one of the originals for decades, and didn't once think about giving it up until she saw the new ones. Not only did she buy the new one, but she told me that she's gonna keep the old one on her porch just to sit in. How about that?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Dragonfly_IG_001_TheDragonflyIs=The Dragonfly is less of a ship and more of a lifestyle.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Eclipse_IG_001_OhIsThere=Oh, is there an Eclipse here? Thing's so stealthy I almost didn't notice it. Just kidding with ya. But seriously, thing's as silent of a predator as they come.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Endeavor_IG_001_TheEndeavorIs=The Endeavor is less of a ship and more of a roaming university. It's all a little bit beyond me, if I'm being honest, but I have it on good authority that if you're in the market for a scientific vessel, this is the one you want.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_F8Lightning_IG_001_ILoveThat=I love that we have an F8 for sale. I remember when these monsters were for the military only. Just look at the thing. Is that a killer or what? Let's see someone try to mess with you when you're flying one of these.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Freelancer_IG_001_IThinkOver=I think over the years, I've sold more Freelancers than just about anything else. I think it's cause MISC made them real jack of all trades. Plus, they really hold on to their resale value.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Genesis_IG_001_JustBetweenMe=Just between me and you, I've always wanted to own a Genesis. I flew on one with my dad when I was ten. We were going to visit my grandmother, and I don't think I had ever been on a ship that big or fancy before. Since then, there's always been a part of me that wonders what it would be like to be a commercial transport pilot. But maybe you buy this one, and then you can come back and tell me what it's like.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Gladiator_IG_001_TheGladiIs=The Gladi is a fascinting bit of hardware. For being so streamlined, it carries some serious ordnance. Almost like a light heavy.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Gladius_IG_001_GladiusIsFast=Gladius is fast, it's maneuverable, and as all the old timers say, it definitely punches above its weight class.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Glaive_IG_001_PeopleAreAlways=People are always eager to point out that a Glaive is just a Scythe with two blades, but it is so much more than that. You know the Vanduul clans only let the most dangerous and experienced pilots fly a Glaive?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hammerhead_IG_001_YouKnowWhat=You know what I've always wondered about the Hammerhead? Do you think they came up with the name first and made the ship match, or the other way around? Either way, it's one of the best patrol ships flying today.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hawk_IG_001_TheHawkIs=The Hawk is what I recommend to any bounty hunter who comes in. It's got the speed you need to run someone down, and guns to spare once you catch up with them.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Herald_IG_001_TheHeraldIs=The Herald is definitely one of the more interesting ships we have on the lot. It's not every data runner that comes with its own broadcast array.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_HerculesStarlifter_IG_001_TheHerculesPerforms=The Hercules performs as advertised. Its got the power needed to haul vehicles wherever, whenever. No easy feat.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hornet_IG_001_YouKnowCal=You know, Cal Mason of Squadron 42 flies a Hornet. If anyone knows about fighters, it's that guy.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_HullLine_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking for a hauler, you can't go wrong with a Hull. They were built to handle cargo, and damn if they don't do a good job of it.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hurricane_IG_001_YouKnowIn=You know in Sataball when you sail one to a teammate and they just tap it in, no problem? The Hurricane is the ship version of that. One of you is flying, the other is on the turret, and together you are just taking care of business.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Idris_IG_001_IfYoureActually=If you're actually in the market for something of this size and power, the Idris is a class all its own. She may not be cheap, but would you trust a cheap frigate?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_KhartuAl_IG_001_TheKhartuStands=The Khartu stands out for a lot of reasons, but those crazy Xi'an stairs alone make it a must buy.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Kraken_IG_001_TheKrakenFollows=The Kraken follows Drake's mantra of why do one thing well when you could do fifty. I've heard of them being used as mini carriers for militias. I've heard of them being used as mobile shopping plazas. Heck, I even heard of one guy who turned the whole thing into some sort of crazy night club. Not that I'm recommending that last one.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_M50_IG_001_IfIHad=If I had it my way, I would be out there flying this bad boy myself. I mean look at those thrusters. The M50 is just begging to be flown.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Mercury_IG_001_YouKnowWhats=You know what's funny about the Mercury? I get people wanting to buy it who don't even want to do data running. They just like the way it looks. Hats off to the Crusader designers on that one.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Mustang_IG_001_YouRememberThe=You remember the Mustang commercial? Where risk meets reward? Well, Consolidated took all the risk, and we get all the reward of being able to fly them. Bottom line is that they are just a fun ship to fly.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Nova_IG_001_WhatABeast=What a beast, right? You think about the war history on these Nova tanks, and it's amazing that you can just walk into a shop these days and buy one yourself. I mean, I used to play with a little toy Nova when I was a kid, and now I get to sell them.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Nox_IG_001_ApparantlyAopoaHad=Apparantly, Aopoa had to modify the Nox for Humans. I guess when Xi'an pilot them, they're bodies naturally enhance the aerodynamics. Our weird Human bodies threw everything out of whack, so they had to reconfigure a lot of things to get it just right for us.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Orion_IG_001_CanYouBelieve=Can you believe that the Orion is a ship that actually flies, and not just some kind of mining station? I mean look at the size of the thing.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_P52Merlin_IG_001_TheP52Is=The P-52 is a great little scrapper to have around to help in a fight. Nimble. Smaller frame which means its harder to hit. And it's easy on the eyes which never hurts.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_P72Archimedes_IG_001_TheArchimedesIs=The Archimedes is the Merlin's more sophisticated sibling. Everything that makes the P-52 so great but a little bit extra sprinkled on top. Definitely would not be out of place if you take it out to the track.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_PTVBuggy_IG_001_ThisLittleBuggy=This little buggy is great for getting around crowded areas like hangars or for short trips around the city.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Pioneer_IG_001_DidYouWatch=Did you watch when Silas Koerner introduced these back at the '47 CitizenCon? Seemed like a pipe dream that a ship could just roll up and start spitting out outposts. Crazy genius did it though, right?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Polaris_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking to upgrade a militia, the Polaris is a no-brainer. It's got the torpedos. It's got the small craft bay. Vanduul see one of these patrolling a system, and chances are those gullets are running for the nearest jump point.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Prospector_IG_001_HeresTheGreat=Here's the great thing about the Prospector: you go out there and find the right spot to mine, the ship will basically pay for itself.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Prowler_IG_001_HardToBelieve=Hard to believe that our great great great grandparents were going toe to toe with ships just like this. All I can say is I feel damn lucky that T-Vars are on our side now.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Razor_IG_001_WhoWouldHave=Who would have believed that MISC could make a racer this sexy?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Reclaimer_IG_001_AReclaimerCaptain=A Reclaimer captain once told me that the only ship she hadn't ever salvaged was another Reclaimer. The things are so tough, they just keep flying.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Redeemer_IG_001_RedeemersDesignIs=Redeemer's design is a real winner, and if you're lucky enough to snatch this one up, it could be your next great gunship.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Reliant_IG_001_TheReliantIsnt=The Reliant isn't any old ordinary ship. MISC shoved the thing just chockablock with Xi'an tech. The way it rotates around feels like something out of a sci-fi spec vid.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Retalliator_IG_001_ImPrettySure=I'm pretty sure every captain out there shakes a bit in their boots when they see a Tali drawing near. This is a bomber desinged to inspire fear. The thing was pretty much made to chew through cap ships.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Sabre_IG_001_AegisReallyGot=Aegis really got it right when they were building the Sabre. It's light, but it still has enough going on that it can hold it's own. My only complaint is that the name is a bit close to a Cutlass. I keep having people come in who are confused about which one is which. Not sure how that's possible, but there you go.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_SanTokYai_IG_001_ItMayNot=It may not seem like the obvious choice, but let me tell you, you show up to a fight in one of these badass Xi'an warrior rigs and you are making a bold statement right there my friend.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Scythe_IG_001_YouKnowMy=You know my favorite part of flying a Scythe? The whole thing is just a big F you to all the duul out there. You tried to kill us, and now we're flying your ship and doing it better than you can. It's a real rush.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Starfarer_IG_001_WhenItComes=When it comes to fuel, the Starfarer is the industry standard for a lot of people.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Terrapin_IG_001_IJustLearned=I just learned a little while ago that Terrapin is a kind of turtle. How much more sense does that name make now? You know like how the ship has all this heavy armor plating just like a turtle shell?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_UsraRover_IG_001_DidYouKnow=Did you know that most new planets found are first explored with the help of an Ursa? They're such a tough and durable rover that it's a natural pick.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Valkyrie_IG_001_ThisThingIs=This thing is less of a ship and more of a mobile fortress. With its heavy armor, you can deliver a full squad of pain and hurt to just about anywhere that needs an ass whoopin.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vanguard_IG_001_TheVanguardDeep=The Vanguard Deep Space Fighter. If you got a fight in deep space, this is the ship you're gonna want to be flying.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vulcan_IG_001_MyNephewJust=My nephew just bought himself a Vulcan. Started his own repair service out in Ferron. Refuels, repairs, rearms. He's really doing well for himself. I mean, I was hoping that he would work here with me, but if he's happy that's all that matters, right.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vulture_IG_001_ThisIsThe=This is the ship you want if you're looking to get into the salvaging game. Plus, you got to admit, the Vulture is just a great name for a ship.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_X1_IG_001_EverybodyWasExcited=Everybody was excited when Origin first announced they were getting into the open canopy market, and when they finally showed the X1, everybody was even more excited. The thing's got style to spare.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Bomer_IG_001_FighterPilotsAlways=Fighter pilots always think they're the heroes, but when it comes right down to it, wouldn't you rather have a ship that can deliver real stopping power like this bomber can?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Combat_IG_001_IfYouDo=If you do any mercenary work or you're just worried about security, than a fighter like this is a great way to put your mind at ease. Good offense is the best defense, right?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Data_IG_001_JustTheOther=Just the other week I was watching Kaizen on the spec, and they were going on about how data is gonna be the future. Seems like this would be the perfect time to get data ship of your own.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_DropShip_IG_001_IAlwaysHear=I always hear people talking about space superiority, but for my credits, you're gonna want some boots on the ground. That's where a drop ship like this really shines. You can strategically insert a team where you need, when you need.

PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Fuel_IG_001_IAlwaysSay=I always say, you want to see a genuine smile, fly a fuel ship. You'll never feel as appreciated as you do when you top off someone who moments before had been stuck on the drift. Ships like this are the real lifeblood of the 'verse.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Industrial_IG_001_AtTheEnd=At the end of the day, what you really want to know is, can this ship get the job done? And if you're lucky enough to be her new owner, I think you'll know that answer soon enough.

PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Medical_IG_001_ItImpressesMe=It impresses me to no end to think about all the brave men and women out there, risking their lives to help save the lives of others. Takes a real special kind of person to fly a medical ship, no doubt about that.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Mining_IG_001_YouKnowWhats=You know what's great? No matter what the government's doing, who the military's fighting, what system you're in, there's always one constant. People are gonna need resources. That what makes a ship like this such a great investment.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Racing_IG_001_WhetherYouveBeen=Whether you've been racing for years, or you're just looking to get started, she's got what it takes to take home some trophys. All that's missing is the right pilot.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Salvage_IG_001_NowWhileAll=Now, while all the ships we sell are made to last, there's plenty of them out there that aren't so lucky. Salvage ship like this is always in demand.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Snub_IG_001_SnubsMakeA=Snubs make a great addition to any fleet. You want to hit up a moon on the weekend, or just take a fly around a planet, this'll make a quick work of it, and you don't have to spend all the extra credits on flying out a ship bigger than you need.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Support_IG_001_CannotExpressHow=Cannot express how happy it makes me every time I get to sell a ship like this. It's a tough life out on the black, and support ships make it a bit better for everyone. You could say flying a ship like this is almost noble in its own way.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_Welcome_IG_001_HeyWelcomeGreat=Hey, welcome. Great to have you.

PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Purchase_EncourageASOP_IG_003_AllRightIm=All right, I'm having the crew bring it around and your new ship should be all ready for you at the ASOPs whenever you want to take her out.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Purchase_PaymentResponse_NotEnoughCredits_IG_001_OhThatsTough=Oh, that's tough. Not enough credits, huh? Maybe something else around here is more in your price range.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Chat_SmallTalk_IG_002_YouDoAny=You do any of those Schrader seminars? They really realign your thinking, how you view the universe, and all that. The key to it is a meditation called "goal fixation." Made a helluva a lot of sense. You should look into it.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Chat_SmallTalk_IG_003_YouKnowIm=You know, I'm an aspiring entrepreneur by trade. All this is great and all, but it's just the day job, you know? I do some promotion, artist management on the side. Yeah, I got a bunch of irons in the fire if you catch me. It's just a matter of time before something pops.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_Bed_IG_001_ThisOneEven=This one even comes with some habitation facilities, perfect if you're gonna be on the drift for a while.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_Copilot_IG_001_GotAnExtra=Got an extra seat in there for a co-pilot, can help run secondary ship functions or maybe just act as a backup pilot so you can get some rest.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_MannedTurret_IG_001_ThisOnesAlso=This one's also got a manned turret, which if you ask me, raises the value ten-fold. I'd rather have a dedicated turret gunner than someone playing a video game remotely.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_Missiles_IG_001_ThisOneComes=This one comes fully stocked with missiles. Nothing changes the tone of a battle faster than guidance-locked ordnance, am I right?
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_Multicrew_IG_001_LookingForA=Looking for a multicrew ship? This one's a beaut. Crewed one myself a couple years ago before I got this gig.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_OpenCanopy_IG_001_WithAllThe=With all the barriers we put between ourselves and our environments, there's something tremendously freeing about piloting without any. Don't you agree?

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_SingleSeat_IG_001_ThisOnesFor=This one's for a solo pilot. It's a little bit more work as you have a lot more to pay attention to, but I find there's something satisfying about flying solo.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_VTOL_IG_001_YouveProbablyNoticed=You've probably noticed the VTOL thrusters on this. They'll give you ultra-precise maneuvering when navigating around a landing pad. And require a lot less room to take off.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Aegis_IG_001_IfICan=If I can be honest, if you'd asked me five years ago, I'd have told you that Aegis Dynamics was dead in the water as a manufacturer, but nowadays they are everywhere.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Anvil_IG_001_ThereArentMany=There aren't many manufacturers that have the rep that Anvil ships have. From what I hear, they run every design through a rigorous internal review process before even starting production to make sure the ship is exactly what they want to make. Pretty impressive when you think about it.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Aopoa_IG_001_TheXianMake=The Xi'an make interesting ships, I'll give them that. You don't really see lines like this in Human construction.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Argo_IG_001_PeopleDontReally=People don't really mention Argo when talking about prominent manufacturers, but I guarantee, if you go to any kind of work site, you'll probably see this ship there.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_ConsolidatedOutlands_IG_001_ForMyMoney=For my money, there's no ship manufacturer doing more exciting things than Consolidated Outlands. Silas Koerner's a true visionary. Ships like this are just proof of that.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Crusader_IG_001_OneOfThe=One of the things I like about Crusader ships is that they aren't flashy. They aren't trying to redefine the wheel. They're just creating good ships and creating them well.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Drake_IG_001_YouKnowPeople=You know, people like to give Drake a hard time about the fact that some criminals like to use their ships, but I'll be honest, I've seen outlaws in every kind of ship imaginable. Doesn't change the fact that Drake makes good ships.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Esperia_IG_001_ALotOf=A lot of collectors tend to gravitate to Esperia ships. I'm not into reproductions myself, but just look at it... the level of detail they put into them is pretty staggering.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Kruger_IG_001_IActuallyUsed=I actually used to race in a Kruger ship. Long time ago. It was purely amateur, but yeah, I was pretty good. People told me I could'a gone pro.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_MISC_IG_001_IKnowRsi=I know RSI usually gets the credit for building ships for regular people, but if you ask me, it's MISC. I mean, think about it, look at all the industrial ships they've constructed, how engrained they are with hauling, mining, even racing now. I don't know, MISC seems to be making a run for the title.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_OriginJumpworks_IG_001_IDontNeed=I don't need to say anything, right? I mean, an Origin ship is an Origin ship. Just take a moment, look at that. You know what I mean.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_RSI_IG_001_YouCanNever=You can never really go wrong with an RSI ship. It's not the most exciting sales pitch, but it's true. They've pushed innovation for centuries. You don't get to do that if you're making crap.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Tumbril_IG_001_LookingForSome=Looking for some terrestrial technology? Tumbril's a good brand. Though they just relaunched, the tech's been around forever. I guess why fix what isn't broken.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageBrowsing_IG_003_TakeAWalk=Take a walk around, and just breathe it in, you know. It's a big decision.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageBrowsing_IG_005_HeresWhatYou=Here's what you do. Just walk the place. If I'm making a decision as big as you're making, I like to take everything in before I do anything.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageDecision_IG_003_IllGiveYou=I'll give you a moment. Maybe go for a walk to think it over. That's always been my trick if I want to clear my head and look at the problem fresh.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageInspectShip_IG_001_FeelFreeTo=Feel free to hop in and take a feel. Don't take off though. <laugh> I'm kidding, you can't.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageInspectShip_IG_002_IfYouSee=If you see one you like, then go ahead and try it out. We've got the inhibitors on so don't you worry about crashing or blowing up the shop.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageInspectShip_IG_003_AllTheShips=All the ships should be open, so climb in and see how it feels. Odds are, you'll be spending a lotta time in there.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageSimCab_IG_001_WeAlsoHave=We also have a simcab if you wanna take any out for a spin.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageSimCab_IG_002_TheresASimcab=There's a simcab too, if you really want that complete experience of flying the ship.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageSimCab_IG_003_FeelFreeTo=Feel free to check out our simcab if you wanna see what flying the ship's really like. It's just like the real thing. I promise.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageTerminal_IG_001_WhyDontYou=Why don't you step on over to our terminal if you're looking for additional info. That can take care of you almost as good as I can. Promise.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageTerminal_IG_002_GoAheadAnd=Go ahead and hit up the terminal if you need. We usually have some extra inventory on there that's not on the floor.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageTerminal_IG_003_YouNeedAnything=You need anything else, check out the terminal. That'll have all those numbers and data if that's what you're into. Me, I'm all about how it feels.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_IG_001_YouGotA=You got a lot to think about, no question, but not for too long, a deal this good won't last.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_IG_002_JustSayThe=Just say the word and I'll start the paperwork, but it seems pretty obvious to me that the two of you are destined to be together.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_IG_003_SoWhatDo=So what do you think? We got a deal or what?
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_IG_004_IMeanIts=I mean it's a lot of credits, sure, but what do you really have to think about?
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_IG_005_ItsYourMoney=It's your money, but if it were me? The choice feels pretty obvious.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_UsedShip_IG_001_TheresNothingWrong=There's nothing wrong with buying used, you know. Every single one of mine I've bought secondhand. At least you know it's not gonna blow up the first time you turn it on.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_UsedShip_IG_002_IDontKnow=I don't know why you wouldn't buy used. Sure you don't get the bragging rights of saying it's brand new, but you ask me, used ships got more character.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_UsedShip_IG_003_HonestlyIfIt=Honestly if it were up to me, I'd charge more for used ships. They've been out there. Tested. You know they can deliver. New ships? They got nice paint jobs.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Fast_IG_001_IllLevelWith=I'll level with you. If you're looking to go slow, you need to walk away from this one right here. It's almost a psychological condition. You start up this monster, you'll be peeling metal.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Fast_IG_002_YouGotAn=You got an eye for speed, I see. Well, if that's the case, look no further. This one right here can knock paint off a space station. I had a customer even bring one back because it was too intense.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_001_ImSensingA=I'm sensing a connection here. Do you feel that? Yeah, you do. That's my superpower, sensing connections. Makes sense when you sell as much product as I do.

You get all these people clamoring for the 'newest, hottest thing' but give me worn and tested any day.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_003_HeresTheThing=Here's the thing, I could hit you with stats, figures, hull compression strength or whatever, but honestly, the decision's been made. You knew from the moment you looked at her.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_004_ForMyMoney=For my money, there's nothing I'd rather be piloting than this bad boy right here. It's everything you need, when you need it. In fact, if you're not gonna buy it, I might get it for myself.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Strorage_IG_001_LookingForA=Looking for a transport? You could do a lot worse than this one. Plenty of open space for hauling whatever the hell you want.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Strorage_IG_002_OneOfThe=One of the great things about this baby here is space. If you're looking to haul, you can't go wrong with this model. I used this very ship to help move my parents into their new home. One of the easiest moves I've ever made.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_100Series_IG_001_YourEntryInto=Your entry into the world of Origin ships, but don't let that fool you. The 100s got all the excellence and design of its bigger brothers.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_890Jump_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking for a ship that emits success, look no further. But I don't need to tell you that. Look at it. Success is basically forged into the hull.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_ArgoMPUV_IG_001_TheMpuvIs=The MPUV is short for Multi-Purpose Utility Vehicle. Argo has been pumping these things out like crazy. If you go to any kind of factory, hauling or mining facility, I guarantee you're gonna run into ten of them. Needless to say, they're popular for a reason.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Arrow_IG_001_YouWannaKeep=You wanna keep it fast and light. The Arrow's your ship. Anvil built her as a combat alternative to the Gladius. Were they successful? Depends on who you ask, maybe you can tell me where you land on it.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Aurora_IG_001_PeopleLikeTo=People like to sleep on the Aurora. Sure, you line it up against all the other ships in the 'verse and yeah, maybe it's a little weak, but I'll tell you this. I still fly mine every day. How many ships can you say that about?
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Avenger_IG_001_YouGottaLove=You gotta love Avengers. For the longest time, everybody would immediately mistake you for a cop when you flew by. Still do in some parts of the Empire probably.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Blade_IG_001_TheVanduulLight=The Vanduul light fighter, lovingly... is that the right phrase? Anyway, created by the artists over at Esperia. This thing's light, it's nimble and a pitch perfect recreation of the original Vanduul design.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Buccaneer_IG_001_YouTalkTo=You talk to most dogfighters and they'll swear Aegis or Anvil up and down the show, but here's the thing. This bad boy right here is a born scrapper. You got a handful of guns at your disposal and enough speed to keep you out of someone's crosshairs. The rest is up to skill.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Carrack_IG_001_ImNotSure=I'm not sure if you're one of those who hear the call of the unknown, who have that gnawing desire to discover, to see what lies beyond. If that's you, than this... this is what you want at your side.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Caterpillar_IG_001_ImpressiveIsntShe=Impressive, isn't she? Asymmetrical hull design. Multiple cargo compartments to maximize your capacity. Even some crew living quarters for long runs. You know this ship design is almost a hundred years old? It just goes to show that ships don't have to be pretty to be innovative.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Constellation_IG_001_MyBrotherUsed=My brother used to say that he'd only really feel like a success if he could buy a Constellation. That, to him, was the pinnacle of space travel. To be fair, it's a helluva ship.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Crucible_IG_001_IllAdmitI=I'll admit, I was a little surprised to hear that Anvil was doing a repair ship. I guess blowing ships up gives you a pretty solid understanding of how to put them back together.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Cutlass_IG_001_EverybodysGotAn=Everybody's got an opinion on the Cutlass. This was the ship that basically put Drake on the map. Gets a bad rap these days, but I don't know. At the end of the day, the ship's versatile, easy to maintain and affordable. None of that sounds bad to me.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Cyclone_IG_001_CyclonesHaveBeen=Cyclones have been racing around for hundreds of years. Like I always say, if there's something I gotta do planetside, a Cyclone can help pull it off.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Dragonfly_IG_001_ICantRide=I can't ride one of these things. I go too fast. It's just that addictive.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Eclipse_IG_001_TheEclipseJust=The Eclipse just reeks of pure warfare. I mean, come on, stealth bomber? How bad ass is that? I don't even want to bomb anything but this ship makes me want to.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Endeavor_IG_001_IWasAlways=I was always bad at science. Barely passed my classes to get Equivalency. But I got a ton of respect for people who like studying stuff. You strike me as a real intellectual so this ship would probably make a lot more sense to you.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_F8Lightning_IG_001_OhYeahThe=Oh yeah, the F8. It's what I like to call 'combat sexy.' It's got all the tools you need to absolutely wreck people, and it looks so bad ass doing it.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Freelancer_IG_001_ProbablyTheMost=Probably the most popular ship in the entire MiSC line, the Freelancer's become one of the standard go-to's for haulers, explorers, hell, there are even some couriers who use them.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Genesis_IG_001_WeveAllBeen=We've all been on a Genesis at some point in our lives if we've done any kind of interstellar travel. The thing's basically the standard for commercial starliners.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Gladiator_IG_001_AnvilsGladiatorA=Anvil's Gladiator. A lotta people tend to right this bad boy off as a single-function ship. Good at dropping ordnance and not much else. But they forget that it's a multi-seater with a turret and some decent guns.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Gladius_IG_001_GladiusIsA=Gladius is a bonafide classic. I guarantee you walk up to any person, old or young, and they can pick this ship out of a lineup immediately. It's fought in wars, defended homesteads, everything. The Gladius is the dogfighter by which all dogfighters are measured.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Glaive_IG_001_YouWatchThe=You watch the Lost Squad? This is the exact type of ship that... oh what's his name... that Vanduul commander. I can never pronounce it. Anyway, this is what he flies. It's the variant of the Scythe that they give to their aces. Anyway, you should check out the show. It's pretty great.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hammerhead_IG_001_AhTheHammerhead=Ah, the Hammerhead. Not sure if you've ever seen one of these throw down, but... let's just say wow. It's one of those cap ships that's designed to handle fighters. Anyway, when this thing's firing all barrels, Navy pilots used to call it the Bloom of Death. Cool, right?
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hawk_IG_001_AnotherPopularStarter=Another popular starter ship, the Hawk here's been increasingly popular with amateur bounty hunters or anyone who needs to chase people down and shoot at them.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Herald_IG_001_DrakesDataRunner=Drake's data runner is basically the answer to the question of what happens if you strap a cockpit onto a thruster. Not great on turns, but when you're going that fast, who cares.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_HerculesStarlifter_IG_001_OddsAreIf=Odds are if you need to move vehicles from planet to planet, you're looking at one ship. That's this baby right here.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hornet_IG_001_YouGottaLove=You gotta love the Hornet, right? Take a moment, look at her. Sure, she's a little boxy, but is there any ship more associated with space combat than the Hornet? I don't think so. Maybe the Gladius...
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_HullLine_IG_001_WhenYouOnly=When you only care about cargo space and nothing else. No frills. No amenities. Just cargo. There is a Hull for you.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hurricane_IG_001_SpeedAndGuns=Speed and guns. A lethal combination in the right hands. You'll need it too. See the Hurricane here... well, to put it bluntly, isn't the sturdiest of ships. In a nutshell, it's a lot better at dishing out punishment than taking it. Not that I'm trying to dissuade you, just that you should know before buying.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Idris_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking into buying a frigate, I might have to close early today. Aegis' Idris has been the go-to for everybody from the UEE Navy to megacorps. Show up in one of these and I guarantee you make an impression.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_KhartuAl_IG_001_ThisOneWas=This one was the first ship Aopoa was allowed to sell in the UEE. A modification of the Xi'an military's light fighter, the Khartu'al is agile and surgical.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Kraken_IG_001_ALT_ThingsABeast=Thing's a beast, right? A customer of mine, who's very satisfied with this purchase, referred to it as the Human equivalent of the Merchantman. I'm not sure if that's exactly right, but it was a funny analogy.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Kraken_IG_001_ThingsABeast=Thing's a beast, right? Comes as a mobile strike carrier or a mobile marketplace. A customer of mine, who's very satisfied with this purchase, referred to it as the Human equivalent of the Merchantman. I'm not sure if that's exactly right, but it was a funny analogy.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_M50_IG_001_IHopeYou=I hope you aren't allergic to speed. It's damn near impossible to keep a beast like the m50 in anything remotely resembling a reasonably safe speed.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Mercury_IG_001_TheCrusaderReps=The Crusader Reps hate it when I call the Mercury a blockade runner. They think it's implying that it was built for illegal use, but I think it's a compliment. You want to move some cargo or got a courier job but you gotta do it with speed, agility, and pack a nice punch? Mercury's got your back.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Mustang_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking for a versatile starter ship, I personally recommend the Mustang. Silas Koerner's a personal hero of mine and what he's done with this ship is really something.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Nova_IG_001_AnotherBangerFrom=Another banger from Tumbril, the Nova is a modern update of the classic battle tank. This thing can shred targets on the ground or in the air. The main cannon is absolutely deafening. It's pretty cool.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Nox_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking to blast around in a truly futuristic open canopy racer, I can't recommend the Nox enough. The thing absolutely blazes.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Orion_IG_001_RsisDedicatedMining=RSI's dedicated mining platform. The Orion's the one you go to when you need large scale mining solutions.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_P52Merlin_IG_001_CoolRightTheres=Cool, right? There's something to be said about short-range ships. There's a purity to the experience that I kinda lose when I get in the bigger ones.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_P72Archimedes_IG_001_IllBeHonest=I'll be honest, I love taking this baby out for a little spin during breaks. Not this one here, we got another in the back, but seriously, if you're looking for something short-range, the P72 is where it's at. Hands down.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_PTVBuggy_IG_001_ThisLittleBuggy=This little buggy is just what it is. No frills. Dependable and fun as hell to drive. Buddy of mine used to build race tracks for them.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Pioneer_IG_001_ImpressiveIsntIt=Impressive, isn't it? I'm not sure if you read Silas Koerner's last book, but he talked a lot about technology throughout Human history. You ask me, I think this ship's gonna change things. It's opening up planetary settlement in really exciting ways.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Polaris_IG_001_PartOfRsis=Part of RSI's larger capital ship skunkworks, the Polaris is a corvette-class combat vessel. They released it as part of the UEE's Militia Mobilization Initiative, but private Merc companies and even Corporate Security outfits have been snatching them up.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Prospector_IG_001_ThereAreSome=There are some who say the Prospector's just a starter ship. That it's for amateurs, but here's the rub. Sure, it's not taking down massive hauls, but it's for people who like to work.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Prowler_IG_001_EsperiaGotSome=Esperia got some ridiculous access to an original Tevarin model to create this line of replicas. You ask me, this looks like something out of a Spec vid. Back in the war, they'd use these to drop boarders on capital ships. How nuts is that?
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Razor_IG_001_WhenMiscAnnounced=When MISC announced they were jumping into the racing game, I was like 'what?! no way.' but the second you fire up the engines on this puppy... you put away your doubts.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Reclaimer_IG_001_IllTellYou=I'll tell you. If you're looking to chew up some debris, you absolutely cannot go wrong with the Reclaimer. This thing is the patron saint of salvage.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Redeemer_IG_001_TheRedeemerWas=The Redeemer was a bit of an experiment for Aegis, but the gunship has definitely found some supporters in the private contractor arena. You ask me, it's because of those rotating nacelles.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Reliant_IG_001_MiscsReliantIf=MISC's Reliant. If there's anything that signifies how far our relationship with the Xi'an has come, it's this ship. Hell, the damn thing turns vertical like one of theirs.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Retalliator_IG_001_HeresTheThing=Here's the thing, if you need to absolutely bomb something into last week. You need a Retaliator. They been doing it for hundreds of years.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Sabre_IG_001_NowThisThis=Now this, this is a fun ship. While you've got the Hornet for brawling, the Sabre's a more elegant alternative. Fast and precise lethality. I came up with that.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_SanTokYai_IG_001_AopoasReallyUpping=Aopoa's really upping their game in the UEE markets, the San... San'tak... however you pronounce it is supposed to be a scrapper through and through.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Scythe_IG_001_VanduulScytheProbably=Vanduul Scythe. Probably the most known fighter in their armada. This one here? This was captured from a Vanduul defector in Orion. I'm kidding, it's a repro made by Esperia. Looks pretty convincing, right?
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Starfarer_IG_001_OneOfThe=One of the big boys of hauling, you can't really go wrong with the Starfarer.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Terrapin_IG_001_TheTerrapinHere=The Terrapin here, it's got a real interesting history, but you aren't here about history, right? If you want to push out beyond the reach of civilization, search for the new, then this is the ship for you.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_UsraRover_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking to do some planetside exploration, look no further. The Ursa may not have the speed as something like the Cyclone, but it's rugged, dependable and capable of going anywhere.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Valkyrie_IG_001_BeforeIStart=Before I start talking, just take a moment and breathe in this ship. <pause> Anvil's Valkyrie. Designed as a heavy troop transport, it's armed, it's armored, it's a killer.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vanguard_IG_001_YeahTheVanguard=Yeah, the Vanguard here's one of the newer ones from Aegis. They'd had some older heavy fighters back in the day, but they went back to the drawing board with this one to create something thoroughly modern and undeniably deadly.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vulcan_IG_001_AegisVulcanSmall=Aegis' Vulcan. Small, mobile refuel and rearm ship. It's perfect for do-gooder types and budding entrepreneurs. This is one of those ships that pays for itself. You get one of these out on the drift and I guarantee you'll be pulling in credits in no time.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vulture_IG_001_LookingToCrack=Looking to crack into the salvage game? I don't blame you. There's some good money in it. My dad dragged scrap for years and never hated a day of work. Drake dropped the Vulture here to provide a small, solo option for salvage pilots.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_X1_IG_001_OriginsAdditionTo=Origin's addition to the open canopy market. Spared no expense either. Aside from the usual Origin quality, they even brought back Alberto Vara to design the thing, so it's not just fast, but beautiful.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Bomer_IG_001_BeCarefulIm=Be careful! I'm just kidding. This bad boy's a devastator though. Capable of delivering ordnance with surgical precision. Now, I don't know what you're looking to blow up with this, but I'll just say that whatever it is, it doesn't stand a chance.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Combat_IG_001_WellIfYoure=Well, if you're looking to tear it up with somebody, you could do a lot worse than this one here. This one's a surefire, Grade-A certified brawler.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Data_IG_001_AfterThatOrigin=After that Origin hack from a few years ago, everybody's putting more stock in securing their data, so ships like this are becoming more and more in demand.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_DropShip_IG_001_WhatYoureLooking=What you're looking at here is a combat juggernaut. It's got firepower, sure. Armor, check. But it's really designed to punch through defenses and deliver troops. Here's the thing though, dropships like this aren't only good for dropping people off, they make excellent extraction ships too.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Exploration_IG_001_IAlwaysAdmired=I always admired people who wanted to explore the universe. I'm too much of a homebody. Take me away from anytime food delivery and spectrum feeds and I lose my mind.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Fuel_IG_001_LookingIntoA=Looking into a fuel ship, huh? You can't go wrong with this one.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Industrial_IG_001_IndustrialShipsAre=Industrial ships are definitely a bit of a niche market, but without fail, I hear good things about this one here.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Luxury_IG_001_YouCantReally=You can't really put a price on luxury. I mean, you can obviously, but in a larger sense, the ability to travel in the ultimate comfort in an environment designed in the pursuit of pure excellence can't really be quantified.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Medical_IG_001_WeDontHave=We don't have a lot of medical ships and to be honest, I'm not as schooled about them, but I've heard good things about this one. Paramedic from Ferron came through last week and gave me the run down.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Mining_IG_001_MyOldMan=My old man was a miner. Sixty years sledging rock on planets, asteroids, you name it, he cracked it. I learned early on, that life wasn't for me, but if it's something that you're looking into pursuing, you can't go wrong with this ship here.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Racing_IG_001_RacerHuhYouve=Racer, huh? You've got that look. Well, if you need a new rig, this one can definitely sort you out. Speed, agility, all the things that'll pay out in spades on the track.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Salvage_IG_001_GoodEyeTheres=Good eye. There's a lotta business out there for salvagers. I'm not sure if you're new to the industry or a veteran, but this model here is pretty well regarded.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Snub_IG_001_IllAdmitI=I'll admit, I got a soft-spot for snub nose ships. Yeah, they don't have the kind of features that the larger ships do, but to me they're efficient. Fast, lean, stripped down. They get down to the essence of flying.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Support_IG_001_TheseAreThe=These are the types of ships that keep the universe together. Support ships like her are the backbone of Humanity. If you ask me, it's a proud tradition for those who take up the call.
