HurstonSecurity_RepUI_Description=As Hurston Dynamics continued to expand their manufacturing operations in the 25th century, it became necessary to hire more security personnel to protect valuable stock, monitor employee safety, and guard shipments. Rather than shoulder the continued expense of outsourcing, Hurston would create an internal security force to take over these duties. When Hurston acquired the rights to Stanton I in 2865, it was only natural for their own security personnel to take over the responsibility of ensuring the peace and safety of the planet. A common sight on the streets of Lorville, members of Hurston Security are an imposing presence able to quickly respond when the need arises.

IAE2951_Sign_Aegis_01_body=Few companies have had as tumultuous a history as Aegis Dynamics. From its earliest days manufacturing iconic warships of the First Tevarin War through the darkest days of the Messer regime, Aegis ships have found a resurgence in the public eye for their versatility and robust construction.
IAE2951_Sign_Aegis_01_title=ICONIC VERSATILITY
IAE2951_Sign_Aegis_02_body=No ship manufacturer personifies this year's theme better than Aegis Dynamics. Whether you're running cargo in a Retaliator or providing security in a Gladius, Aegis ships are putting in work in every corner of the 'verse. Regardless of the controversies that have plagued them over the centuries, pilots continue to trust their lives and livelihood to their tried and true designs.
IAE2951_Sign_Aegis_02_title=TRIED AND TRUE
IAE2951_Sign_Aegis_03_body=Establishing fire superiority can be the key to victory. Aegis designers consulted with both active and former members of the UEE military as well as security forces to find out what was and wasn't currently represented in the latest generation of combat gunships. The result? The Aegis Redeemer. Originally debuted years ago, Aegis made the somewhat controversial decision to delay the release of this battlefield equalizer to redesign the interior.
IAE2951_Sign_Aegis_03_title=KEY TO VICTORY
IAE2951_Sign_Anvil_01_body=Anvil Aerospace may have made a name for itself along the frontlines with its masterfully built fleet of military craft, but more and more of the company's civilian craft have captured the imagination of the Empire. Look no further than the Anvil Carrack to see a ship that has transitioned easily from its Naval origins to the very edges of space as pilots use the ship to chart new territory.
IAE2951_Sign_Anvil_01_title=CHART NEW TERRITORY
IAE2951_Sign_Anvil_02_body=As the war against the Vanduul continues, many pilots find themselves seeking a way to protect their home and loved ones during these uncertain times. Anvil Aerospace has been a strong ally in this endeavor, creating civilian versions of their popular military craft, like the Hornet F7-C, to protect you and the ones you care about. 
IAE2951_Sign_Anvil_02_title=STRONG ALLY
IAE2951_Sign_Anvil_03_body=Despite the Aerospace in its name, Anvil has hardly been limited to the skies. For example, the tough and rugged Atlas vehicle platform was developed to help conquer the unforgiving landscape found on moons and planets alike. Both the Ballista and the Spartan were both built from this design foundation, proving its adaptability.
IAE2951_Sign_Anvil_03_title=TOUGH AND RUGGED
IAE2951_Sign_Argo_01_body=Contrary to popular belief, Argo Astronautics name doesn't come from the ancient water craft of Earth mythology, but rather is derived from the initials of the company's founder Alana Redmond and is attributed to her mother.
IAE2951_Sign_Argo_01_title=TRUE ORIGINS
IAE2951_Sign_Argo_02_body=If you're looking to crack into the cargo hauling market, look no further than Argo's new RAFT. This small multi-crew ship utilizes Argo's experience in the industrial ship market and a versatile design to create an affordable entry-level ship that's ready for the long haul.
IAE2951_Sign_Argo_02_title=VERSATILE EXPERIENCE
IAE2951_Sign_Banu_body=It's not uncommon for Human manufacturers to offer unique features and designs to make their ships stand out from the crowd, but the Banu take a slightly different approach when it comes to crafting their vehicles. Heavily and freely borrowing from each other and even other species, Banu ships are made by combining the best features and best technology that they can get their hands on. 
IAE2951_Sign_Banu_title=BORROWED FREELY
IAE2951_Sign_Best_body=Selected by popular vote, the IAE Best in Show line up is a chance for your favorite ships to take center stage at the expo. At least most of the time. At the 2938 Expo, that year's winners were all ships too large to actually fit inside the show hall!
IAE2951_Sign_Best_title=BIGGER ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER
IAE2951_Sign_CO_body=One of the newer ship manufacturers to debut at the IAE, Consolidated Outlands has already made its mark on the Expo when it introduced the first ever mobile construction yard in 2947. The Pioneer opened up exciting opportunities for planetary settlement by allowing settlers to create their own modular structures, and forever changing the idea of what a spacecraft could do.
IAE2951_Sign_CO_title=MODULAR IDEAS
IAE2951_Sign_Crusader_01_body=Crusader Industries continues to surprise ship enthusiasts around the empire. Initially known for their commercial transports like the Genesis Starliner and the Hercules Starlifter, Crusader has been expanding into the civilian market with the introduction of their Ares Star Fighter and Mercury Star Runner. Needless to say, the future is bright for this titan of astro-engineering.
IAE2951_Sign_Crusader_01_title=BRIGHT FUTURE
IAE2951_Sign_Crusader_02_body=Unlike many of their competitors, Crusader Industries dedicates as much effort on their employees as they do on their products. Recognized as one of the UEE's best employers in 2943 and 2946, Crusader not only offers competitive pay and benefit programs to all employees, but also houses extensive in-house  training and education programs to foster talent and take their workers to the next level of their career.
IAE2951_Sign_Crusader_02_title=TOP TALENT
IAE2951_Sign_Crusader_03_body=Although Crusader Industries might be best known for their transports, their recent introduction of the Ares Star Fighter shows that the charity-minded manufacturer is taking a new approach to helping citizens across the Empire, and more specifically those who live on Crusader itself. With recent attacks by well outfitted groups like XenoThreat and the Nine Tails becoming all too common, its easy to see why a powerhouse like the Ares was added to their line-up.
IAE2951_Sign_Crusader_03_title=NEW POWERHOUSE
IAE2951_Sign_Drake_01_body=Mention the name Drake Interplanetary in a room and you're sure to kick off some debate. To some, they're villains, arming the most dangerous elements in the 'verse with the tools to wreak havoc. But did you know that this criminal connection was only made possible because Drake ships were so common? In the infamous Kesselring Heist of 2903, a Drake caterpillar was used specifically because it was easy to blend in with the masses in flight.
IAE2951_Sign_Drake_01_title=ONE OF THE CROWD
IAE2951_Sign_Drake_02_body=No one brings the thunder to IAE quite like Drake Interplanetary. Love 'em or hate 'em, their ships have become versatile and affordable options for everyone from security and militia forces to haulers trying to scrape a living out in the black. The Drake Red medic ship was recently recognized for the 'most lives saved' thanks to the ship's usage in medstations and hospitals around the UEE. 
IAE2951_Sign_Drake_02_title=LIFESAVER
IAE2951_Sign_Drake_03_body=Introduced in 2887, Drake's Buccaneer almost begs its pilots to pick a fight. While it doesn't have the versatility of something like the Hornet, the Bucc's got heart... and enough firepower to make it a serious threat in any engagement. Though it's been associated with multiple crimes throughout the Empire, it's also become a mainstay for local security forces and militias looking to keep the peace.
IAE2951_Sign_Drake_03_title=READY TO FIGHT
IAE2951_Sign_Esperia_body=Though the Expo attracts the latest innovations and technological wonders, Esperia is constantly paving the way forward with their reverence of the past. Preserving important historical craft and xeno-vehicles, Esperia defines spaceflight in entirely new ways by providing unique experiences that would otherwise be unavailable to modern pilots.
IAE2951_Sign_Esperia_title=HISTORICAL REVERENCE
IAE2951_Sign_FPS_body=You may be wondering why an Expo focused on vehicles and spacecraft would want to highlight personal armor and weapons. While its true that getting there is half the fun, what you do when you arrive is just as important. Having the perfect gear on board will help ensure that a landed pilot will be ready to take off again soon.
IAE2951_Sign_FPS_title=GEAR UP
IAE2951_Sign_Greycat_body=Greycat Industrial holds the distinction of having the most ever vehicles at a single IAE when in 2926 a thousand buggy parade was driven through the streets of Severus. The highlight was when all of the buggy's sounded their horns together to play a rendition of the Imperial anthem. 
IAE2951_Sign_Greycat_title=IMPERIAL PRIDE
IAE2951_Sign_MISC_01_body=It's common knowledge that MISC builds some of the hardest working ships around, but to get that tough a lot of thought and careful consideration had to go into even the smallest of details. To find the best panel adhesive, MISC ran over a million thermocycle shock tests at their R&D center. The winner alone was able to survive tens of thousands of cycles without failing. Talk about being built to last.
IAE2951_Sign_MISC_01_title=CAREFUL CONSIDERATION
IAE2951_Sign_MISC_02_body=Represented in almost every industry, MISC continues to create reliable, durable, and versatile ships at a variety of pricepoints. One of their toughest tests is known affectionately as the "Meat Grinder." Though the specifics of the test are a proprietary secret, insiders claim that the test aims to inundate the prototype ship with nearly three dozen adverse conditions, sometimes attacking with three to four at the same time in an effort to prove that their ship can survive the harshest of the harsh conditions.
IAE2951_Sign_MISC_02_title=DURABLE RELIABILITY
IAE2951_Sign_MISC_03_body=MISC's latest addition to their already impressive line of ships perfectly encapsulates the spirit of this year's IAE. Push the boundaries of the known universe with their new multi-crew wayfarer ship, the Odyssey. Get a sneak peek in the holoviewer room. Only at the IAE.
IAE2951_Sign_MISC_03_title=BOUNDARY PUSHING
IAE2951_Sign_Origin_01_body=Luxury. Elegance. Performance. These are only a handful of the terms that are regularly associated with Origin Jumpworks ships. Since the 28th century, Origin has consistently pushed the boundaries of speed and sophistication, but did you know that their controversial decision to uproot their headquarters from Earth to Terra in 2913 nearly sank the company?
IAE2951_Sign_Origin_01_title=SPEED AND SOPHISTICATION
IAE2951_Sign_Origin_02_body=Perpetually expanding what's possible when it comes to high-end performance vehicles, Origin Jumpworks is a fan favorite at the IAE and this year's lineup is sure to impress. When attempting to design a new addition to their roster, Origin engineers have looked for inspiration from a variety of sources. For example, when initially brainstorming designs that would ultimately become the X1, Engineering Director Alberto Vara looked to musical notes to dictate the potential shape language of the open-canopy racer.
IAE2951_Sign_Origin_02_title=ENDLESS INSPIRATION
IAE2951_Sign_Origin_03_body=Initially concepted to be a competitor for RSI's classic Constellation line, Origin's 400i quickly developed  its own singular identity. Utilizing Origin's usual high standards of performance and comfort, the 400i evolved into a ship for explorers who didn't feel the need to 'rough it' while pushing the boundaries of the known.
IAE2951_Sign_Origin_03_title=SINGULAR IDENTITY
IAE2951_Sign_Pilots_body=While it may be commonplace to sail through the stars, we should never lose sight of the wonders of space flight from discovering new jump points, unearthing lost ruins, or setting new speed records. Famed artist, Aruto Divani, created this unique portrait series as a tribute to the diverse array of people who eagerly climb aboard their ships and 'Dare to Fly.'
IAE2951_Sign_Pilots_title=SAIL THE STARS
IAE2951_Sign_RSI_01_body=Some historians credit Roberts Space Industries with the invention of modern spaceflight. For founder Chris Roberts, the prospect of making space travel more accessible was a lifelong dream and when his company unveiled their prototype Quantum Core Engine in 2075, suddenly, space travel didn’t seem that fantastical anymore.
IAE2951_Sign_RSI_01_title=DREAMS ACCOMPLISHED
IAE2951_Sign_RSI_02_body=It's pretty amazing to think that RSI makes one of the smallest ships on the market and one of the biggest. It would take about 50 Auroras laid end to end to equal the length of one mighty Bengal carrier. 
IAE2951_Sign_RSI_02_title=SMALLEST TO BIGGEST
IAE2951_Sign_RSI_03_body=Since its introduction in 2712, the RSI Constellation has been reimagined countless times, proving itself as varied and long-lived as Roberts Space Industries itself. It has been a cargo hauler, an explorer, a luxury liner, and more. When asked what's next for the Constellation, RSI Designer Deshondra Lewin said "Whatever it is, we will always strive to balance innovation with the tested features that pilots have come to rely upon." 
IAE2951_Sign_RSI_03_title=RELIABLE INNOVATION
IAE2951_Sign_Theme_body=The theme of this year's expo is "Dare to Fly" which celebrates the courage of pilots everywhere who boldly take flight to discover new thrills, to seek adventure, and to push boundaries farther than ever imagined. With the right ship and the right frame of mind, anything is possible.
IAE2951_Sign_Theme_title=DARE TO FLY
IAE2951_Sign_Welcome_body=Hello and welcome to the 2951 Intergalactic Aerospace Expo.

IAE2951_Sign_Xian_body=Xi'an ships are becoming a more common sight across the UEE, but it wasn't too long ago that their sale was completely forbidden by the Xi'an Emperor. Now, thanks to growing trade between our two species, Xi'an manufacturers like Gatac and Aopoa are producing vehicles specifically for Humans to pilot. Even more promising, some new ships have been designed for Human and Xi'an crew to serve along side each other.

IAE2952_Sign_CDFHeroes_body=For this year's IAE, we would like to honor the brave volunteers of the Civilian Defense Force who never fail to rise to whatever occasion calls for them.\n\nDriven by a sense of duty and a desire to protect their community, these heroes put their lives on the line as they foiled the Nine Tails' Siege of Orison, defended the INS Jericho from XenoThreat's attack, and provided humanitarian aid in the immediate aftermath of the catastrophic storm that struck Borea's western continent earlier this year.\n\nShould the need rise again, let the courage of these CDF volunteers be a reminder that we all have the potential to be heroes.

IAE2952_Sign_CDFHistory_body="A system's best defense will always come from its residents."\n\nSpecial Agent-in-Charge Bryce Balewa argued this point for years before becoming a leading proponent for the Civilian Defense Force (CDF), a volunteer militia called upon by the UEE military and Advocacy to provide support during times of crisis. His extensive experience in law enforcement convinced him a strong and trusted partnership between not only local security forces, the Advocacy, and the Navy, but also skilled individuals, would be the best security option for helping to safeguard the people of the UEE. In 2944, Balewa gave a speech at the Civilian Security Summit on this exact subject and was approached after by Amanda Xiang, a prominent lawyer and militia rights activist. Together, Balewa and Xiang drafted a proposal calling for the formation of the CDF so locals, either independently or as part of a militia, could be quickly deputized as provisional law enforcement in times of an emergency. The Civilian Defense Force was officially created in January of 2947 and after months of intensive planning, the fledgling organization had its first mission to help evacuate people on Tangaroa (Helios II) threatened by sudden and intense volcanic activity. Whether it’s defending shipping lanes from raids by increasingly aggressive outlaw packs or running relief to those affected by natural disasters, the CDF has quickly proven to be a vital part of system security across the empire and has become a beacon of the people’s power to overcome adversity when they work together.

IAE2952_Sign_WarAtHome_body=THE LATEST FRONT IN THE FIGHT FOR SAFETY\n\nWhile the brave forces of the UEE work diligently to protect all of us from Empire-level threats, there are still ever-present dangers lurking closer to home. Millions of innocent people across every system find themselves in a daily struggle for their very lives against a surge of crime at a level unprecedented in the history of Humanity.  \n\nConsidered trivial by some, compared to the Empire’s war against the Vanduul, this growing wave of violence has remained unchecked for far too long. With the recent heinous actions of criminal gangs like the Nine Tails and XenoThreat, Drake Interplanetary has partnered with the Intergalactic Aerospace Expo to bring attention to this ongoing struggle, and to provide you with the resources you need to claim your strength and protect what's yours. \n\nTogether, and armed with the right ships and equipment, we can take the power back and win this war.

Info_Kiosks_Handbook_Desc_001=PRISONER HANDBOOK\n\nHello and welcome to this Klescher Rehabilitation Facility. While you serve out your sentence, we hope this handbook helps make your experience here more productive by answering a few key questions.\n\n1. HOW CAN I LEARN MORE ABOUT MY SENTENCE?\n\nIf you ever would like to find out information regarding your sentence, feel free to check the 'YOUR SENTENCE' tab on the information terminal. From this tab you can check:\n\n• Merits Earned: Keep track of the number of merits earned through our work-release program.\n\n• Remaining Time Until Release: An accurate countdown until your release. \n\n• Time Served: The amount of time you’ve been a guest in our facility.\n\n• Sentence Extensions: If your original sentence has been extended due to guideline infractions, you can find a list of those extensions and the reasons. \n\n2. CAN I SHORTEN MY STAY?\n\nThis Klescher Rehabilitation Facility offers a variety of work-release programs that will keep our guests busy during their stay. \n\n• Mining: This underground Klescher facility offers our guests a unique opportunity to earn merits and shave time off their sentence by mining commodities in the nearby tunnels and depositing them in the mineral deposit hoppers. You will be issued a time reduction chit or "merit" based on the total value of the deposit.*\n\n• Maintenance Tasks: We will pay guests in merits to fix up faulty equipment around the facility. \n\nFurther details can be found on your mobiGlas.\n\n3. WHAT IF I NEED SUPPLIES?\n\nCommissary Dispensers contain a selection of food, drinks, and other useful items to make your stay more comfortable that may be purchased with merits earned through our work-release programs. These dispensers are conveniently placed around the entrances to the work mines.\n\n4. IS VIOLENCE EVER THE ANSWER?\n\nViolence is never the answer. Any violence committed against Klescher personnel or your fellow guests is strictly forbidden and will result in an immediate extension of your original sentence.\n\n5. WHAT IF I WANT TO ESCAPE?\n\nWhile we understand the desire, any attempt to prematurely end your term in our facility is strictly forbidden, as is using your mobiGlas to communicate with anyone outside the facility. Failing to adhere to either of these guidelines will result in an extension of your original sentence.\n\n*Mineral prices are static and set by Klescher Company and do not reflect real-world commodity prices.\n
