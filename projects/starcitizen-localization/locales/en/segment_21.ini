PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpReg_IG_001_HiThisIs=Hi, this is Dulli. Glad to see you stepped up for another emergency. We're still not entirely clear why, but the Nine Tails have taken over the Restricted Airspace around several Crusader platforms and we need you help us regain control. While their inverter device is running, only Nine Tails ships have access, so for now our only way in is via shuttle. Once inside however, there should be several vehicles already in the restricted area that will be operational and should help you disable the inverter. Head to the shuttle as soon as you're ready.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpReg_IG_002_ThisIsSpecial=This is Special Agent Dulli. Thanks for lending us a hand again. So far, all we know is that Nine Tails have taken over several Crusader platforms by using an inverter to control the Restricted Airspace. We haven't heard any demands so we don't know if they're after something in particular or just causing chaos. What we do know is that until the inverter is shut down only Nine Tails ships and any vehicles already on the platforms have access. That means our ships don't work and we'll need to shuttle you in. I'll provide more details as they come, but for now, head over to the shuttle as soon as you're ready.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpReg_IG_003_DulliHereThanks=Dulli here. Thanks for volunteering again. Here's the situation. A large group of armed outlaws known as the Nine Tails have seized control of four Crusader platforms using a Restricted Airspace inverter. This makes it impossible for any non-Nine Tails ships to approach until the inverter is deactivated so that will be your primary job. We've gone ahead and commadeered a shuttle to get you to platform, and once you're inside you should hopefully be able to find a vehicle within the Restricted Area to use. Head to the station once you're ready.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpRook_IG_001_ThisIsSpecial=This is Special Agent Dulli with the CDF. Just wanted to thank you for volunteering. Anyway, we need your help taking back some Crusader platforms from the outlaw gang known as the Nine Tails. They have set up an inverter to seize control of the platform's Restricted Airspace so only their ships can access the area. Since we can't fly in ourselves, we got a shuttle ready to take you to the platforms where we want you to deactivate the inverter. Gather any gear you need and make your way to the station. I'd also recommend creating an imprint at Orison General in case you need to regen. Talk to you soon and thanks again.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpRook_IG_002_HelloThisIs=Hello, this is Dulli with the CDF. Thanks for volunteering. Here's the situation. Nine Tails are currently controlling four platforms and the Restricted Airspace around them, preventing anybody but their own ships from approaching. We need you to get inside to find and deactivate the inverter. We're currently using a nearby shuttle station to send our forces to the closest platform. Gather any gear you need and head there now. You should also create an imprint at Orison General in case you need to regen. Thanks again and talk to you soon.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpRook_IG_003_ThisIsDulli=This is Dulli with the CDF. I appreciate the help. Here's the current sit-rep. A large group of armed Nine Tails operatives have taken control of the Restricted Airspace around several Crusader platforms using an inverter system, making it so only their ships can fly into the area. This means a conventional assault's impossible. Instead we're using a shuttle from a nearby station to get our people on site in order to shut down the inverter. Grab your gear and we'll send you over. Oh, I generally advise all CDF volunteers to set their regen at the local medstation in case things go bad, so I'd recommend hitting up Orison General before you come out. Thanks again.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpVet_IG_001_JustSawYou=Just saw you signed up and wanted to say I'm glad we have some veterans answering the call. We're going to need experienced volunteers like yourself since the Nine Tails have gained control of the Restricted Airspace around several Crusader platforms.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpVet_IG_002_GladToHear=Glad to hear you're going to be joining us for another operation. The Nine Tails have managed to take control of the Restricted Airspace around several Crusader platforms. We're counting on you to shuttle over to the platforms and help us take them back. Make your way there as soon as you're ready.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpVet_IG_003_ItsDulliJust=It's Dulli. Just wanted to thank you for volunteering. Having tried and tested operators on our side is always beneficial for the new recruits.  Long story short, Nine Tails have seized control of the Restricted Airspace around multiple Crusader platforms. We can't launch a full aerial assault until you fight your way through and help us retake it. Take the shuttle to the platform as soon as you can.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_WithCrimeStat_Siege_IG_001_ThisIsSpecial=This is Special Agent Dulli. I appreciate the effort, but it looks like you've got an active CrimeStat.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_WithCrimeStat_Siege_IG_002_ThisIsDulli=This is Dulli with the CDF. Thanks for volunteering, but we can't accept anyone who's got an active CrimeStat. There's a chance that you could be mistaken for an outlaw in the heat of battle. Get it resolved and we can talk.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_HardIsland_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_002_WantedToGive,P=Wanted to give you a quick update. CDF volunteers have taken out this platform's lieutenant but the anti-air's still active. Since there isn't a direct shuttle between this platform and the Admin Center, you'll need to take out this AA in order to safely commandeer a ship.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_HardIsland_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_003_JustAHeads,P=Just a head's up.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_VeryHardIsland_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_002_HeresTheLowdown,P=Here's the lowdown. The lieutenant of this platform's already been neutralized but the anti-air is still operational.

The lieutenant's been taken out but CDF volunteers haven't found an IFFI here.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_VeryHardIsland_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_001_IActuallyDont=I actually don't know if this platform has a name. Crusader's just referenced it as the Admin Center. There aren't any ships to commandeer here, but if you're able to take it back from the Nine Tails, you should be able to make your way to the cargo barge by foot.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_VeryHardIsland_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_002_ThisIsThe=This is the Admin Center. I'm not entirely sure what it's used for, probably Admin, but Crusader says there aren't any ships here, so you should be able to get to the barge by foot.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_C2Starlifter_Siege_IG_001_HappyToSee=Happy to see a Starlifter. With the C2, we could potentially strengthen our ground position on the other platforms by transferring ground vehicles between them. Just need to be careful of any active AA.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_C2Starlifter_Siege_IG_002_ThisC2Could=This C2 could make a big difference to the Op. Not only can the starlifter hold its in own, but being able to move ground vehicles could come in real handy. As long as you can avoid any remaining anti-air defenses that is.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_C2Starlifter_Siege_IG_003_NiceAC2=Nice, a C2. The CDF has worked with these on other operations. They're sturdy and the cargo space gives a lot of flexibility. Looking forward to seeing what you can do with it. Just be sure to keep an eye out for any remaining Nine Tails AA when you're flying.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_M2Starlifter_Siege_IG_001_TheStarlifterIs=The Starlifter is an impressive piece of military hardware. More that a few battles have been won with the M2s help. Will be good to have one in the air. Just be careful engaging with any remaining AA defenses.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_M2Starlifter_Siege_IG_001_TheStarlifterIs_edit=The Starlifter is an impressive piece of military hardware. Will be good to have one in the air. Just be careful engaging with any remaining AA defenses.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_M2Starlifter_Siege_IG_003_AllRightAn=All right, an M2. Exactly what we needed. These are some of the toughest ships Crusader makes.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_PiscesShuttle_Siege_IG_001_NotSureHow=Not sure how the Pisces is going to do here. It's light and nimble, which is good, but with the AA defenses on these platforms still active something with more armor might make sense.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_PiscesShuttle_Siege_IG_002_SeeYouFound=See you found a Pisces. As long as you avoid any direct AA fire, a smaller craft like this could be a good choice for infilitrating the platforms. But if you find an option with more armor that might be the safer choice.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_PiscesShuttle_Siege_IG_003_IWouldHave=I would have gone for something with a bit more armor than a Pisces, but then I'm not the best pilot. In the right hands, a smaller craft could be a smart option for navigating the platforms. Guess we'll see.
