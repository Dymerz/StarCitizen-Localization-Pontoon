recoverstolen_danger_0002=We've got our hands full right now, so if things go south out there we won't be able to provide you with any back up. Go in expecting to handle any surprises on your own. 
recoverstolen_danger_0003=We did some preliminary scouting of the site and it should be clear, but experienced operators know better than to rely on that to keep them safe. 
recoverstolen_danger_0004=The thieves responsible might still be lurking around, so use caution. 
recoverstolen_desc=~mission(Description)
recoverstolen_desc_0001=We have been fortunate enough to track down a ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) that recently was reported stolen. It is being held in ~mission(Location). We need an operator to go in, reclaim their property and return it to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryDanger)
recoverstolen_desc_0002=An informant of ours has given us word that a ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) taken from ~mission(Destination) is being held at ~mission(Location). We are seeking a independent operator to handle the retrieval of said ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) on our behalf and return it to its rightful owners. ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryDanger) 
recoverstolen_desc_0003=This rarely happens, but believe it or not some missing property that's been our radar just surfaced at ~mission(Location). Intact too! Now all we need is someone to give the whole thing a happy ending and return the ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) to our clients at ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryDanger)
recoverstolen_desc_0004=After contacting us about a recent theft at ~mission(Destination), we were able to apply our tradecraft and trace their stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) to ~mission(Location). All the hard work is done, all that's left is the actually physical retrieval. Think you're up for it? ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryDanger)
recoverstolen_desc_0005=Every time you think criminals can't get any dumber, they surprise you again. These geniuses stole some~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) from ~mission(Destination) but we were able to trace it right back to their ~mission(Location). Should be a simple matter for an operator to head in, retrieve the item, and return it to its proper owners.~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryDanger) Though if I'm being honest, I wouldn't be surprised if these draggers thought it was magic or something once they notice the ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) is missing. 
recoverstolen_desc_0006=Good news. After a client of ours suffered a theft, we were able to trace their ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) to where the criminals were holding it at ~mission(Location).

recoverstolen_space_desc_0001=An independent investigation has resulted in the location of a recently stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) being tracked down. We believe it to currently be in the possession of one ~mission(TargetName), an affiliate of the ~mission(client) with a known record. ~mission(contractor) is looking for a skilled individual to track down ~mission(TargetName)'s ship, recover the lost property, and return it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Danger)
recoverstolen_space_desc_0002=~mission(contractor) is seeking an experienced operator to handle the retrieval of a stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) which our investagtion team has learned to be aboard the ship of known ~mission(location) affiliate; ~mission(TargetName). Once recovered, the ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) will need to be taken to its rightful owners at ~mission(destination). ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Danger)
recoverstolen_space_desc_0003=Small miracle. Some good folks over at ~mission(destination) had a ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) stolen from them, but we've actually been able to track it down. Turns out some scag by the name of ~mission(TargetName) has the stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) aboard their ship right now. However, a skilled operator should be able to hunt their ship down and return the property to where it belongs. ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Danger)
recoverstolen_space_desc_0004=A ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) was reported stolen by one of the workers over at ~mission(destination). As a nice change of pace, we actually got a solid lead on the ~mission(client) member that pulled the job who's currently going by the handle: ~mission(TargetName). Now all we need is a suitable contractor to handle the recovery operation on our behalf. ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Danger) Serious applicants only. EDIT: ** THIS IS NOT A GUILD JOB **
recoverstolen_space_desc_0005=We have it on good authority that a stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) is currently aboard the ship of ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(contractor) needs a pilot, preferably with combat experience, to retrieve the stolen property and return it to its proper owners at ~mission(destination). ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Danger)\n\n*This contract agreement is considered at-will, and may be terminated at any time by either party.
recoverstolen_space_desc_0006=Got a break today. After a client of ours over at ~mission(destination) got robbed, we were able to trace their stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) to the ship of one ~mission(TargetName).

refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastCareful=Pyrometric Chromalysis
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastCareful_Desc=This higher-than-average priced refinement process uses a series of very precisely controlled heating chambers to slowly extract the wanted material over the course of the thermal cycle and remove insoluble impurities through chromalysis to result in an above average yield.
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastCareful_Details=Low Speed // High Cost // High Yield
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastNormal=Gaskin Process
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastNormal_Desc=This process exposes raw material to quick bursts of Gaskin solvents to break down and remove impurities through inductive filtration. This fast but expensive process results in an average final yield. 
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastNormal_Details=High Speed // High Cost // Moderate Yield\n
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastWasteful=XCR Reaction
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastWasteful_Desc=This process employs an array of highly corrosive reaction agents to rapidly dissolve unwanted materials. Developed by the Navy to expedite wartime material production, this costly refinement method makes up for its lower than average yield with its high rate of turnover.
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastWasteful_Details=High Speed // High Cost // Low Yield
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalCareful=Ferron Exchange
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalCareful_Desc=This recently developed process returns a high yield of refined product at a slightly below-average rate for a nominal cost. By using a resonant distillation process inside a flux-retort, the desired materials can be separated from the raw slag while minimizing waste.
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalCareful_Details=Low Speed // Moderate Cost // High Yield
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalNormal=Electrostarolysis
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalNormal_Desc=This moderately priced electrochemical process uses a pure sample of the desired final material as an anode to attract and bond the chemically dissolved raw material resulting in an average yield percentage and processing time.
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalNormal_Details=Moderate Speed // Moderate Cost // Moderate Yield\n
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalWasteful=Cormack Method
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalWasteful_Desc=This readily available and relatively quick process, invented by Art Cormack in 2321, injects the molten material with a stream of reactive gas that bonds with common impurities. The resulting insoluble byproduct can then be filtered from the refined molten slurry producing a relatively low final yield.
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalWasteful_Details=High Speed // Moderate Cost // Low Yield
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_SlowCareful=Dinyx Solventation
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_SlowCareful_Desc=This process slowly sublimates raw materials in a pressurized Dinyx chamber and then over time recrystallizes the vaporization in zero gravity to remove impurities as off-cast and produce a high yield of refined product. 
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_SlowCareful_Details=Very Low Speed // Low Cost // High Yield
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_SlowNormal=Thermonatic Deposition
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_SlowNormal_Desc=Through slow application of repeated heating and cooling cycles, the raw materials can be separated according to their specific thermonatic properties and produce a moderate refined yield.
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_SlowNormal_Details=Low Speed // Low Cost // Moderate Yield
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_SlowWasteful=Kazen Winnowing
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_SlowWasteful_Desc=Despite its moderate processing rate and relatively low yield, Kazen Winnowing, first developed in the 22nd century, is still frequently used thanks to its relatively simple set-up and lower price point. Once the raw material reaches its liquidis temperature, high pressure gas is introduced and used to winnow any remaining impurities.
