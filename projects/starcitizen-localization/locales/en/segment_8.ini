Hints_SignatureSystem_EmissionHUD_01=The Emission Bars on the HUD indicate the strength of your ship’s signature emissions vs. the current environmental Ambient Signature. \nWhen your ship's emissions are less than the Ambient Signature, you become harder to detect for that signature type.

The narrower the Ping, the less area the wave will cover and the more it will amplify encountered signatures.\nTap ~action(spaceship_radar|v_inc_ping_focus_angle) to narrow the Ping Angle and increase amplification. Tap ~action(spaceship_radar|v_dec_ping_focus_angle) to widen the Ping Angle and increase the covered area.

Hints_SignatureSystem_ScanModeEntered_01=To analyze a target while in Scan Mode, first adjust your direction so that the desired target is within the Scan Reticle. \nThen hold ~action(spaceship_scanning|v_scanning_trigger_scan) until the Scan Progress Bar on the right is full.

Hints_SignatureSystem_ScanStarted=The Scan Progress Bar to the right of the Scan Reticle fills as information is obtained. Keep holding ~action(spaceship_scanning|v_scanning_trigger_scan) to receive all currently available info.\nThe amount of information available is linked to the Signature Strength. Fill the Signature Strength Bar to left of the Scan Reticle to make more information about the target available.\n
Hints_SignatureSystem_ScanZoomChanged=To adjust the sensitivity of your Scanner and improve Signature Strength, try increasing your Scan Focus. Note that an increased Focus may make targets more difficult to follow.\nIncrease Scan Focus using ~action(spaceship_scanning|v_inc_scan_focus_level). Decrease Scan Focus using ~action(spaceship_scanning|v_dec_scan_focus_level).
Hints_SignatureSystem_Scanning_Title=Scan Mode

Hints_TractorBeam_OnTetherBreak_Distance=Both weight and distance factor into the tractor beam's ability to tether to a target.\nThe heavier the object, the shorter the tether will need to be for the beam to function.
Hints_TractorBeam_OnTetherBreak_LineOfSight=If the tractor beam path to the target is interrupted or blocked, the tether will break.\nMove carefully while the tractor beam is engaged to prevent accidental release.
Hints_TractorBeam_OnTetherBroke_ViewCone=Attempting to move a tethered object too fast will sever the tractor beam.\nAdjust the multi-tool's aim carefully to prevent accidental release. 
Hints_TractorBeam_OnTetherToTarget=To move a tethered object use  ~action(player|rotatepitch) and ~action(player|rotateyaw).\nTo adjust the length of the tether itself, use ~action(tractor_beam|tractor_beam_increase_distance) and ~action(tractor_beam|tractor_beam_decrease_distance).

Hints_TractorBeam_TargetCantLift_Size=Some objects are too large for the tractor beam to safely manipulate.\nThe multi-tool's HUD will indicate if an object is an appropriate target. 
Hints_TractorBeam_Title=Multi-Tool - Tractor Beam
Hints_TractorBeam_ZeroGTraversal=While in zero-g, tethering to a large enough object (like a ship or station) will pull you towards it.
