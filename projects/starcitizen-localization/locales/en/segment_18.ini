Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_MidDeck_01_Body=Lovingly referred to as "warhalwa" by the crew, the UEES War Hammer has had one special dish on its mess hall menu since the ship entered service in 2832. This carrot halwa, a sweet, cardamom-spiced pudding, was the special request by the War Hammer’s first Captain, Omar Singh, in celebration of his birthday. It has since become a tradition among the crew to eat this dessert on special occasions and celebrations. Lt. Con Timway credited the carrots in the dish for setting the new naval accuracy record in 2902.

Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_MidDeck_02_Body=On July 7, 2884, the UEES War Hammer was part of the naval defensive action against the Vanduul now commonly known as the "Fall of Caliban." While providing cover for the civilian evacuation of the system, the turrets were fired so frequently and for such an extended duration that XO Sander Freelin’s after action report noted that "turret support struts had begun to warp from the heat of the sustained fire." Gunner Tobin Lemk commented in a letter home, "I could hear my sweat sizzle as it dripped off me." As a result, Aegis Dynamics reworked the cooling systems in future Javelin models.

Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_MidDeck_03_Body=While no sign of the incursion remains, the UEES War Hammer was boarded in a surprise assault on June 25, 2861 when a Vanduul boarding ship, known in the Navy as "Spikes," made it past the UEES War Hammer’s point defense systems and punctured the hull. While five off-duty starmen tragically perished in the first moments of the assault, the crew were able to rally and overwhelm the Vanduul boarders before they managed to gain control of any vital parts of the ship. These brave starmen were instrumental in the War Hammer’s eventual victory that day.

Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_MidDeck_04_Body=Among the crew of the UEES War Hammer, the first step of this stairwell is commonly known as the "Skip Step." For a brief period in 2928, the gravity plate located directly below the step was intermittently malfunctioning. This resulted in numerous starmen tripping and stumbling as they used the stairwell. As a health hazard, repairs were immediately done but despite numerous attempts at correcting the issue, the problem kept returning. During this time the crew formed a habit of not utilizing the first step as a precaution. In the end, it turned out to be a software issue in the gravity controls, but the tradition of hopping over the "skip step" remains today.

Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_TopDeck_01_Body=Ever since the line’s introduction in 2690, the Javelin has been a brawler. Unlike other ships that can fulfill multiple roles like transport, the engineers at Aegis Dynamics clearly intended for this ship to put itself in harm’s way. Aside from the turret installations that line these halls, the Javelin comes fully stocked with heavy ordnance to challenge capital ships and a complement of Marines to raise hell on the ground. Simply put, the Javelin is a fighter.

Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_TopDeck_02_Body="I remember the exact moment that I stepped aboard the UEES War Hammer for the first time. To me, it was already a legendary ship. Sure, most people dream about serving aboard the Krugeri or something, but I’d grown up hearing about the War Hammer. My dad served on it immediately after graduation, so I think the thing that struck me most was its sense of history. This was a ship that’s distinguished itself in some of the biggest military operations of the past hundred years and the crew always seemed to carry that shared sense of duty to live up to the high standards set by the last generation of crewmembers. I could see why it had such a profound effect on my father and why it continues to have a profound effect on me."\n- Adelle Marker, Leading Starman
Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_TopDeck_02_Title=A PROUD LINEAGE
Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_TopDeck_03_Body=As you’ve been exploring the halls of this famed vessel, here are some facts that you might not have known:\n\n- Since its sealing in 2832, over 5000 Naval and Marine personnel have served aboard the War Hammer. Some notable crew members include: Ari Barber (actor, served as gunner 2854-2857), Natalya Jesui (pilot, served as navigator 2905-2911), Lee Cardenza (Sataball player, served as mechanic 2932-2935).\n\n- There’s a tradition among Captains of the War Hammer to leave a bottle of liquor and a blank paper journal in their quarters for their successor. This originated with Captain Lionel Ross, who took over from Captain Singh, as the War Hammer’s second captain.\n\n- The Aegis Javelin uses over six million meters of cable for its electrical, data, and automation systems. That’s almost the distance from Moscow to Shanghai on Earth.\n

Invictus_999SquadTerm=SQUADRON 999 F8 LIGHTNING\n\nThe F8 Lightning was developed by Anvil Aerospace as a replacement for the previous generation F7A Hornet fighter. The UEE selected the Anvil Lightning for production because of the Hornet's string of military successes and its overall familiarity with active pilots. The Lightning was developed specifically to counter what the military saw as the rising Vanduul threat of the 2940s, intended to outfly and outfight the current generation of Scythe and Glaive spacecraft. \n\nTo put this new craft through its paces, the Navy's elite test unit, Squadron 999 were given full access to these next generation fighters. After dozens of flights and simulated battles, the skilled "Wreckless" pilots of the 999 provided valuable feedback that helped hone the Lightning into this imposing vehicle poised to make history.

I knew you’d be against talking to them, but I couldn’t risk it not happening. You have every right to be angry at me for keeping it from you, but you know how you get sometimes. Honestly, I don’t know how to handle you when you get all worked up. You’ve been that way since we were kids. Remember that incident with Mom’s Cutlass? Guess I wanted to avoid all that drama until everything was official. \n\nSee... dammit, it’s hard to admit this to you ... Freund Family Fuel is running deep in the red and I don’t see a way out. I did… I did everything I could to try and find a way out, put the house up as collateral for a loan… but nothing worked. Just dumb luck I guess. \n\nSelling to Avivar is our only option to stay flying with some creds in our pockets and a shred of dignity. I know you’d argue with all your heart against it, but you don’t know the numbers like I do. This system’s a different place since Dad started all of this. Dad never had to hire a full time turret gunner for protection. Competition’s grown so fierce that the low fuel prices can’t cover our skyrocketing costs. At least if we operate under Avivar’s banner we’ll have some support during these tough times. The business may not be in our name after this, but it’ll still be ours.\n\nI know you hate me right now, but just remember that, as your brother, I love you and only want to do what’s best for all of us. Well, whenever you’re ready to talk, I’ll be here.\n\n-	J     \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

Guess I didn’t get to the turret fast enough. Adena kept yelling at me that we’d all be dead if the ship was really under attack. \n\nBut it’s not like I was dragging my heels. I’ve just never been on a ship this size before. It’s so easy to get turned around on this thing. Almost feels like someone designed this ship specifically for people to get lost on.\n\nTy keeps telling me not to worry about it. He keeps reminding me that nobody’s first run goes smoothly. Told me yesterday that “the only way you learn is by living.” This would all be super overwhelming if he wasn’t here. Not to say it’s not nice to talk to you about these things too, but by the time the message reaches you and you have the time to respond, sometimes the moment’s passed.   \n\nHeard the Captain and his sister arguing again last night. I’m not sure if they realize how loud they are or maybe they don’t care. Had to crank up the volume on my mobi to drown them out, but then I got worried I’d miss a call to get to the turret, so I turned it back down. Still not sleeping very well. Every little bump wakes me up, then it takes forever to get back to sleep. \n\nAt least I’m making some creds and gaining some experience. Once I get paid, I’ll send a portion to Mom. Maybe now that both of us are working things will be a bit easier for her. Oh, did you ever find out how much experience deckhands need on your ship? How great would that be to work this same ship. Sure Mom would love it too. Both her boys, exploring the stars together. Just like she always dreamed. \n\nCrap … gotta run. Talk again soon, brother.   \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

I’ve done a full assessment of the ship in its current state and come to a ballpark value. It … well, there’s a lot more work to be done around here than I first thought. I added about half a dozen other fixes to my punch list today... you know what, we should probably talk about this in person. That way I can explain how I got to my total. Fair warning, I don’t think you’ll be thrilled with the news.\n\nI know you told me to hold off on repairs for the time being, but I noticed something today that’s a little worrying. The power plant’s having power spikes under normal operations. Could be a busted regulator or something, but it’s best not to strain the system until I figure out what’s going on. Might have to do with those repairs I did to the shield genny the other day. Won’t know until I run a full diagnostic.\n\nAlso, I tweaked a few things on the turret for the kid. He wouldn’t stop complaining about how slow and unresponsive it was, so I made a few minor adjustments just to keep him quiet about it. Kid’s eager, and works his tail off, but he’s as green as they come.       \n\nOne last thing, I’ve been thinking about your last message, taking Avivar’s buyout seems like the best plan. Know your Dad wouldn’t be happy about it, but he’d understand.   \n\nOh, and tell your sister before you go through with it. She definitely won’t like it, but you owe her that much.  \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

This has been a good week for Avivar in the Stanton System. I closed that contract I was telling you about last week. Had to cut them a deal, but like you say, once they experience Avivar’s amazing service, we’ve got ‘em for good. That gives us three in the system. A few more clients like this and we’ll be turning a profit in no time. \n\nIn other good news, I’ve been able to convince a local fuel concern, Freund Family Fuel, to meet with me about a possible buyout. They’ve been around for decades and have a number of primo contracts. I’ve drafted the offer so it allows them to operate under the Avivar name as long as they maintain our standards. Considering the state of their ship and employee records, it shouldn’t be hard to get rid of them following the first performance review. It’s their contracts that we really want. Not their aging Starfarer. Will let you know when I’m closing in on a deal so you can give it final approval. \n\nI know I’ve only been here a few months, but I see a lot of potential for Avivar in Stanton and have some big plans.

Ms. Sarafian, despite a number of subtle and not to subtle requests, only submits her required weekly report for me to review. \n\nThat’s where I was hoping you could come in.

So he’s had the magical relic on board the entire time. That’s why the pirates don’t want to damage the ship and destroy what’s onboard. \n\nPlus, it gives ‘em a reason to board the ship and take him hostage instead of blowing him out of the sky.

Journal_General_ContractManagerTutorial_Content=Welcome to the new Contract Manager!\n\nWith your mobiGlas’ 2.5 network software update, you may have noticed some improvements made to the Contract Manager application. It’s now easier to search through available jobs, accept contracts, and keep all your ongoing work organized. Happy Job Hunting!\n_______________________________________\n\nKEEPING TABS\n\nThe first thing you may notice when you open the Contract Manager from the mG Homespace is that there are now four tabs located along the top of your holo-display.\n\nGeneral - This tab gathers and displays available local contracts which have been Business and Labor Administration (BLA) certified to meet UEE and local law requirements.  \nPersonal - These are offers being sent to your account specifically. Users are encouraged to be cautious accepting unsolicited contracts from unknown sources.\nAccepted - Once you accept an offer, the contract is moved to this tab so that you can quickly access important information relating to it.\nHistory - When a contract comes to end, either through successful completion or by other means, the record of it is kept here for reference.\n\nNEW CONTRACT CATEGORIES\n\nWe have introduced new Contract Categories that automatically group offers by type to make it easier to find the type of job you’re interested in. \n\nAppointments - These are typically offers used to coordinate and schedule in person meetings.\nBounty Hunter - Contracts to pursue and track down specific, possibly dangerous individuals.\nECN - Contracts received through the Emergency Communication Network system.\nDelivery - Transport-related contracts to move cargo and goods between locations.\nInvestigation - Used by insurance companies and individuals to acquire information. (This update also improves the data submission tool to allow users to submit applicable information to the client from the Accepted tab*.)\nMaintenance - Jobs that require manual labor and trade skills such as repair work or hazardous material handling. \nMercenary - Offers in which the contractor is expected to have combat training, such as escort and security work.\n\nACCEPTING CONTRACTS\n\nWith the Contract Manager, after carefully reading all the information, you can apply for and accept job offers** directly from your mobiGlas. Once you have accepted a contract, from the Accepted tab you will be able to see a detailed list of objectives, and can now also track and untrack contracts to have it sync with your StarMap app, as well as cancel contracts already in progress***.\n_______________________________________\n\n* Users may choose to submit their data to the client at any point, whether the matter has been fully investigated or not. Any complications to arise from this are the solely the responsibility of the user.\n** microTech and mobiGlas do not endorse or guarantee any contracts listed in the Contract Manager and are not responsible for any risks associated with accepting uncertified contracts. \n*** microTech and mobiGlas are not accountable for any and all repercussions related to abandoning contracts.

Journal_General_CrusaderCrimeTutorial_Content=Like many who travel to the Stanton System, you may be wondering how the laws and regulations of the four megacorps compare to the laws in the rest of the UEE. While our status as an independent planet allows us latitude to govern as we see fit, you may be surprised to learn that Crusader Industries adheres to many of the legal guidelines set forth by the Empire in order to provide a safe and secure environment for all.  \n\nHere are few tips to remember while visiting Crusader and its surrounding sectors:\n\n* While the level of crime here is typically no higher than many places in the Empire, visitors should be cautious traveling to more remote areas such as the asteroid belt around the moon Yela since outlaw attacks have been known to occur.\n\n* Even though you are in Crusader Security patrolled space, damaging another individual’s ship or interfering with public landing areas are still considered misdemeanors. Note that repeated offenses will be taken very seriously.   \n\n* Beware of contract offers that involve the disabling of comm arrays. Unsavory individuals often try to lure unsuspecting victims to do this illegal task for them under false pretenses, and many travellers have fallen for this scam. Know that TAMPERING WITH COMM ARRAYS IS AGAINST THE LAW and endangers other people’s lives. Anyone caught disabling a comm array will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\n\n* The moons of Crusader are home to many beautiful sights, and touring them is a must while visiting the area. Just be sure to avoid unmarked outposts, bring plenty of fuel and oxygen, and always locate your closest emergency shelter before setting out an expedition.\n\n* Crusader Security encourages individuals to join us in helping promote a safe environment. Whether you help track down a wanted criminal, assist in patrolling nearby sectors, or respond to ECN alerts to help ships in distress, any contributions you make to the community’s overall security will be noted in your records and may go a long way in making up for any previous minor infractions. By working together we can all make Crusader a better place to visit.

Journal_General_Healing_Content=Since its recent introduction, there’s no denying that regeneration technology has changed modern medicine for the better. Across the Empire, patients can now recover from injuries that would have been fatal in the past. However, as impressive as regeneration is, it is not a replacement for traditional care and treatments.\n\nBelow, we will outline a few important tips on regeneration along with some basic medical practices to help safeguard your health.\n\n--REGENERATION--\n\nRegeneration is the medical process in which a holistic bioscan known as an ‘imprint’ is used to recreate a near perfect copy of someone down to their memories. Because of the unique properties of the imprint, it maintains a remote connection to its source at all times and ensures that it can only regenerate someone after they experience a fatal event. \n\nThis connection, known as an ‘echo’, also means that traumatic experiences lower an Imprint’s Viability Score (IVS). Repeated regeneration may produce irregularities during the regeneration process and eventually render the imprint unusable.    \n\nTo create your very own imprint, visit a Tier 1 or Tier 2 medical facility and register on a kiosk. Once complete, that site will then be where you next regenerate. You can also store an imprint aboard a properly equipped vehicle. If the location or vehicle where your imprint is stored becomes unavailable, a back-up will always be available at your primary residence and you will regenerate there. Please note that having an active CrimeStat may have an impact on your regeneration site.\n\nHowever, because of the effect of imprint echoes on the regeneration process, it is important to remember that receiving first aid and medical treatment is always preferable to being regenerated. The following breakdown outlines basic first aid to deal with a variety of injuries to help avoid needing to regenerate.\n\n--FIRST AID--\n\nThe first step when dealing with an injury is to identify how serious it is using a visor HUD, a self-evaluation (i.e. PIT), or if assisting someone else, a medical device. All injuries can be divided into three severity categories:\n\n- Minor injuries can be treated by Tier 3 (T3) medical facilities and are highlighted purple.\n\n- Moderate injuries can be treated Tier 2 (T2) medical facilities and are highlighted mauve.\n\n- Severe injuries can be treated by Tier 1 (T1) medical facilities and are highlighted pink.\n\nTo fully treat an injury, seek out an appropriately tiered facility at a rest stop, landing zone, or medically equipped vehicle. Attempting treatment at an incorrectly tiered facility can temporarily relieve symptoms, but the injury itself will remain. If you are alone and in need of transportation to a medical facility, you should contact a trusted acquaintance or use your mobiGlas to create a rescue service beacon.\n\nWhile injuries can only be treated at an appropriate medical facility, medication can be administered on site to temporarily alleviate associated symptoms. Before heading out a trip, it’s smart to bring along single dose pens, medical attachments, or full healing device with you.\n\nInjection pens are easy to carry and administer, but you will need to bring multiple pens to cover various symptoms and they can only be used once.\n\nSmaller medical attachments, like the LifeGuard for the Pyro Multi-Tool, allow for diagnostic scans and can administer a healing agent like Hemozal, but cannot treat other symptoms. They are typically used in conjunction with injection pens. \n\nFull medical devices like the ParaMed from CureLife provide detailed diagnostic scans and allows for the administration of multiple medicines along with full control of the dosage. However, it can be bulkier and more expensive than other options.\n\nFor ease of reference, here is an alphabetical list of common symptoms and the recommended medicines to relieve them.\n\n--COMMON SYMPTOMS--\n\n- Concussion – Caused by an impact to the head, individuals with a concussion will experience slower reaction times and have a harder time maintaining their balance. Can be relieved with an adrenaline like Demexatrine. \n\n- Health Loss – As displayed on your mobiGlas or bioscan, your ‘health’ is a simplified diagnostic number derived by combining information from several important monitored vitals. Sustaining injuries will cause you to lose health. Health can be restored by administering a healing agent like Hemozal.\n\n- Impaired Mobility – Caused by injuries to the limbs, torso or head, impaired mobility will make getting around difficult. Can be relieved with an opioid like Roxaphen.\n\n- Incapacitation – Individuals who are incapacitated have had their health levels reduced to zero and will be unable to move. This is a potentially fatal condition and a healing agent like Hemozal must be applied must be applied in order to restore mobility. The amount of time until the condition is irreversible will be displayed on your mobiGlas. Note that factors like sustaining additional injures or having other confounding medical issues may impact how long you have. \n\n- Muscle Fatigue – Caused by injuries to the limbs, those suffering from muscle fatigue will move slower and have their refined motor skills affected. Can be relieved with an adrenaline like Demexatrine.  \n\n- Muscle Weakness – Caused by injuries to the arms, muscle weakness makes it difficult to do activities that require strength. Can be relieved with a corticosteroid like Sterogen.\n\n- Ocular Inflammation – Caused by injuries to the head and results in vision obscured by inflamed blood vessels. Can be relieved by a corticosteroid like Sterogen.\n\n- Partial Paralysis – Caused by injures to the limbs, partial paralysis makes it so the affected area is severely impaired resulting in the loss of the ability to do activities like running, climbing, and interacting with objects. Can be relieved with an opioid like Roxaphen.\n\n- Respiratory Damage – Caused by injuries to the torso, this affects lung capacity and makes breathing or prolonged physical exertion very difficult. Can be relieved with a corticosteroid like Sterogen.\n\n- Stunned – A temporary loss of consciousness that leaves the individual unable to move for the duration. Will relieve itself after enough time passes and consciousness is regained.\n\n--BLOOD DRUG LEVEL AND OVERDOSE RISK—\n\nWhile giving first aid is vital, know that it comes with its own risks. Administering medication will increase an individual’s Blood Drug Level (BDL) as will imbibing recreational drugs or alcohol. \n\nA high BDL can create a feeling of intoxication and may result in difficulty moving, blurred vision, and loss of refined motor skills. For your safety and other, it is strongly recommended that you avoid operating a vehicle while intoxicated.\n\nOnce your BDL reaches a dangerous level it is called an overdose. Individuals experiencing an overdose will be stunned and will gradually lose health until they become incapacitated.\n\nFortunately, BDL will reduce naturally over time. Administering a detoxicant like Resurgera will speed the process and make it so you are no longer stunned. \n

Journal_General_Medical_Content=Whether you haven’t been sleeping well, experienced a traumatic injury, or have , most modern digital assistants like mobiGlas include a wide variety of health monitoring capabilities to make staying healthy simpler than ever.\n\nBy constantly monitoring your key vitals, the software is able to make preliminary diagnoses and alert you about dozens of afflictions you may be experiencing. These alerts, when used properly, can offer guidance and help you know when to make lifestyle adjustments, administer self-treatment options, or seek assistance from a medical professional.  \n\nBelow we have highlighted a few of the more common medical alerts that you may see:\n\nConcussed -\nA mild brain injury that results in temporary loss of cognitive function. Early warning signs of a concussion can include double vision, loss of balance, and ringing in the ears.\n\nDehydrated - \nWhen the body does not have enough water to function normally. Symptoms can include thirst, dry mouth, headaches, deteriorating health, exhaustion, and blurred vision.\n\nHemorrhage - \nInternal or external bleeding. It is recommended that you try to stem the loss of blood as soon as possible to minimize deterioration of health.\n\nHyperthermia - \nThe body’s core temperature has risen above safe levels and can no longer compensate leading towards fatigue, severe headaches and migraines, difficulty breathing, deteriorating health, and increased thirst. \n\nHypothermia - \nThe body’s core temperature has fallen below safe levels and can no longer compensate leading towards severe fatigue, shivering, weakness of the limbs, deteriorating health, increased appetite, light sensitivity, hearing impairment and a risk of paradoxical undressing.\n\nMalnourished - \nWhen the body does not have enough nutrients to function normally. Symptoms can include weakness, deteriorating health, irritability, hearing and vision impairment.   \n\nSevere Injury - \nA general term used to describe when very serious trauma has been inflicted to the body. Often accompanied by vision loss. Requires immediate medical attention.\n\nUnconscious -\nWhen trauma is severe enough, an individual may experience a syncope, lose consciousness and become unable to respond to stimuli. \n\n

Journal_General_Nutrition_Content=We all lead busy lives, and sometimes making good nutrition choices can be a daunting challenge to say the least! \n\nThankfully, by using the NDR and HEI ratings assigned to most commercially available food and drinks, taking better care of yourself has never been easier. Just remember, the *higher* the score, the better the nutrition, and the better you'll feel. \n\nNutritional Density Rating (NDR)\nDevised by Empire Health Services to help people eat healthier, the Nutritional Density Rating (NDR) takes into consideration the food’s concentration of nutrients per 100kcal, the breadth and diversity of nutrients contained, and the nutritional bioavailability. The higher an NDR score, the better a food item is for your overall health. However, it is important to remember that no single food contains all the nutrients a single person needs, so along with eating high-scoring food, the second most important thing an individual can do is consume a wide variety of foods. Here’s to good eating and good health! \n\nHydration Efficacy Index (HEI)\nOriginally created by a team of nutritionists at the University of Jalan to compare the effects of beverage choice on hydration levels during long haul space flights, the Hydration Efficacy Index (HEI) has since been adapted by Empire Health Services as the standard measure by which various drink selections can be compared. By considering such factors as moisture retention, absorbency rates, osmolality, caloric count, and electrolyte levels (specifically sodium and potassium), a beverage can be graded using one standardized index. The higher the score, the more effective the beverage is at keeping the consumer hydrated for longer. Substances like caffeine and alcohol have the potential to decrease the index score by increasing the rate of water loss from the body. Standard filtration system water has a baseline score of 80. \n\nDietary Effects\nIn addition to the baseline scores, many foods and drinks have been additionally labeled with keywords to provide extra information about the potential effects that item will have on your health. Take a look at the list below for some of the most common effects and what they mean.\n\nHypertrophic - Provides additional blood flow and nutrients to key muscle groups to make them perform optimally.\n\nAtrophic - Restricts blood flow, negatively affecting the muscles, making tasks seem harder.\n\nEnergizing - Provides a boost to your energy levels, allowing you to be active for longer.\n\nFatiguing - Has a draining effect, causing lethargy and general sense of exhaustion.\n\nCognitive Boosting - Encourages brain function by allowing additional focus while performing complicated tasks.\n\nCognitive Impairing - Stymies brain activity making it difficult to focus for long durations. \n\nHypometabolic - Digests slowly, making you feel satisfied for longer.\n\nHypermetabolic - Digests quickly, increasing the likelihood you'll be hungry sooner.\n\nHydrating - Helps your body to better absorb water, allowing you to satisfy your thirst for longer.\n\nDehydrating - Causes your body to lose water, making you thirstier.\n\nHealing - Provides vital nutrients to help your body naturally repair itself. \n\nToxic - Contains elements that are detrimental to your health and can cause damage if consumed in large quantities. \n\nImmune Boosting - Helps your body stay healthy when exposed to harmful elements.\n\nImmune Suppressing - Weakens your body's ability to fight off harmful elements.\n\n\n

Journal_General_StarmapQuantumTutorial_Content=Now that your mobiGlas has installed to the new 2.5 network update, you are ready to use the StarMap app to travel the stars in a whole new way. For the past year, the engineers at microTech have been working with industry-leading quantum drive manufacturers to allow our award winning StarMap app to seamlessly integrate with most consumer navigation software. This means you can now set quantum travel routes directly from inside the Starmap you are ready to use the StarMap to set quantum travel routes directly.  \n\nTo get started using these new features, follow the quickstart guide below.\n\nSafe Travels!\n\nThe StarMap App Dev Team\n\n_______________________________________\n\n\nSTARMAP QUANTUM TRAVEL QUICKSTART GUIDE\n\n1. From your cockpit chair, open up the StarMap app either by accessing it through your mobiGlas or your ship’s holo-display.\n\n2. Use the StarMap’s controls to pan and zoom around the map, till you see the destination you wish to travel to. (Remember, you may have to zoom in or out to locate a particular destination.)\n\n3. Click on the destination to see a route from your current location highlighted with a green scrolling dashed line. (If the route is inaccessible by a single quantum, it will appear a red static dashed line. If this is the case, you may have to travel to an accessible location first before traveling to your ultimate destination or refill your quantum fuel tank. For any additional issues, contact your quantum drive manufacturer.) \n\n4. Once you have your route selected, you can use the button on the lower left labeled “Set As Destination” to transfer these coordinates to your quantum drive’s navigational computer. The route will now be highlighted by green scrolling arrows.\n\n5. Close the StarMap and you are now set to begin quantum travel. After spooling your quantum drive in preparation, rotate your ship so that your prow is aimed at the diamond-shaped destination marker on your AR display to calibrate the navigational computer. Once spooled and calibrated, you will be able to initiate quantum to your set location. (Remember, you will not be able to quantum travel again till your drive’s cooldown period ends.)

I know the initial speculation was criminal sabotage, but based on this, it looked like worker negligence. Sad as it is to say.\n \nAnyway, I’ve attached a series of files to help illustrate my points and so you don’t have to sift through three million lines of data text.\n \n**/Excerpt_1 ATTACHED/**\n \nI’ve pulled together some sample readings from the Power Distribution logs. As you can see, over the past year, the station has been suffering from sporadic power drains. Maintenance reports theorized that there was a power drain somewhere, but to me, it looks like faulty switchers. These 2920’s were notorious for power flow issues.\n \n**/Excerpt_2 ATTACHED/**\n \nSo here is the initial stress test that Darnell Ward ran the day of the incident. Everything after <i>RUNPROTOCOL stresstest_v3.dnn</i> is the test taking effect. Everything looks good, right? Then, and I haven’t figured out why yet, but a few hours later (and in the middle of the stress test) he runs this <i>all_monitor_silence.dnn</i> protocol. Maybe he was trying to bring monitoring systems offline to see if they were causing the drain. I don’t really know. Anyway, it was a stupid move, because he basically removed his only way to see that the power plant was about to go critical. \n \nI’ll keep digging and keep you apprised.\n \nDennis

LingFamily_Danger_001=Also, some of the family has run into trouble doing similar contracts recently. I would be extra careful. You know it's dangerous when cousin Maggi even says it. 
LingFamily_Danger_002=Also, a word of caution. I've got several reports highlighting this particular stretch as potentially dangerous. I don't think anything will happen, but just be ready in case trouble shows up. 
LingFamily_Danger_003=One more thing. I don't want to raise a false alarm, but there's a small chance that this contract may wind up being riskier than usual. Nothing concrete, but I've got a contact in Crusader Security who gave me a heads up. Should be fine, but be careful. 
LingFamily_Danger_004=And I probably don't have to say this, but Crusader's been having some security issues lately. It's not as safe as it once was, especially where you'll be going for this job. Be smart out there and stay safe. 
LingFamily_Family_001=My brother, Ricki, was supposed to handle this job but unfortunately his cooler blew. He's getting it fixed, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can step in. 
LingFamily_Family_002=My brother, Ricki, was supposed to handle this job but his power plant's been having issues. He's getting it fixed, it'd be great if you can take this one. 
LingFamily_Family_003=My brother, Ricki, was scheduled to handle this, but the quantum drive on his Lancer decided to stop working today. It's being repaired, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can handle it. 
LingFamily_Family_004=My brother, Ricki, is down for the count today owing to his life support system being on its last breath. He's getting it fixed, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can fill in. 
LingFamily_Family_005=Ricki got caught up on the opposite side of Stanton doing a long haul, so we need someone else to handle this job. 
LingFamily_Family_006=I originally had Ricki slated for this, but a leaky fuel line means he's not going to get back in time. Hopefully, you're available. 
LingFamily_Family_007=Fabian, my cousin, commed in sick again. Guess his suit actuator failed while he was doing a drop on Yela and he caught a cold. So we need someone to pick up the slack today. 
LingFamily_Family_008=Got a last minute comm from my cousin Fabian that he isn't feeling well again. Seems he picked up a stomach bug from a bad burrito and can't fly. Would be great if you could cover for him. 
LingFamily_Family_009=Hoping that you'll be able to fill in for my cousin Fabian. Not sure exactly what happened, but seems like his arm is on the fritz and he can't fly till he sees a cybernetician. You'll definitely be helping us out if you're available. 
LingFamily_Family_010=You ever hear of Dolphin Tongue? Well, my cousin Fabian woke up with it. Half his face is swollen to the size of burstmelon. Would you be free to take over for him today? 
LingFamily_Family_011=My cousin Maggi had some trouble with the Nine Tails and is filing a report with Crusader right now. Of course, that could wind up taking all afternoon so I need someone to handle this job for her. 
LingFamily_Family_012=I thought that my cousin Maggi was going to be able to do this one, but she has to chase down a missing order. Hoping that it wasn't stolen. Either way, she's going to be tied up for a while. 
LingFamily_Family_013=Fabian caught a stomach bug and now the rest of the family seems to have got it. To be honest, I'm not feeling so great, but I'm hanging in for now. Since they're all busy making their own "deliveries" until the medicine kicks in, I was thinking you might be able to take care of this job. 
LingFamily_Family_014=A bunch of the family headed over to New Babbage for the day to celebrate another cousin's birthday. And guess who didn't get to go? Anyway, still plenty of work around here that needs doing.

LingFamily_Reaction_BadStreak_001=After that last contract, how many screw ups was that? You know what? I don't want to scold you like you're some kid. I'm just gonna say do better and leave it at that. 
LingFamily_Reaction_BadStreak_002=Seems like you've been having a really hard time getting through these contracts. Last few jobs we've thrown you're way haven't exactly gone as planned. We're not a big company so these setbacks really hurt our bottom line. You're just going to have to do better, okay? Having said that... 
LingFamily_Reaction_BadToGood_001=Guess you're a diamond in the rough, after all. Had a bet going with my sister Linda that you would screw up that last contract. Now I have to make her dinner, but hey, it's better than having to clean up your mess again. Anyway... 
LingFamily_Reaction_BadToGood_002=Way to turn it around. I was getting worried about you, but that last contract showed you got potential. We'll have to see if you can keep it up... 
LingFamily_Reaction_Bad_001=Rough time on that last contract, huh? It happens. Important thing is not focus on it too much, and get back out there - 
LingFamily_Reaction_Bad_002=Hard to say exactly where you went wrong on that last contract, but it wasn't pretty. Let's do better this time, Okay? 
LingFamily_Reaction_GoodStreak_001=Got to say, you've really been killing it out there. Even Davi's been impressed and he's been doing this for decades. Anyway... 
LingFamily_Reaction_GoodStreak_002=I'm starting to think we got pretty lucky finding you. You've been giving Ling Family Hauling a good name out there with all the recent work you've been doing for us. Speaking of... 
LingFamily_Reaction_GoodToBad_001=That last contract got away from you or what? Don't worry though. Screwing up every once in a while is what being part of the Ling Family is all about. (Don't tell them I said that.) 
LingFamily_Reaction_GoodToBad_002=Tough break on that last job. Can't be perfect all the time, I guess. Unless your my sister Linda. But let's not talk about her right now... 
LingFamily_Reaction_Good_001=You did good on that last contract. Nice stuff. 
LingFamily_Reaction_Good_002=Real quick, wanted to mention the last contract you did. Saw that it went well. Good work. That said... 
LingFamily_Reaction_LastWarning_001=So far, I think as a whole, Ling Family Hauling has been more than fair with you. But this contract is the end. Either you get it right, or we're done working with you. That simple. That said... 
LingFamily_Reaction_LastWarning_002=Listen, this contract here? This is your last chance. We can't afford to risk any more business on you unless you find a way to turn things around. That said... 
LingFamily_Reaction_Renew_001=Okay. So, I'm gonna tell you straight. If it had been up to me, we would have burned your contact, but dad seems to think you deserve another chance, so here we are... 
LingFamily_Reaction_Renew_002=Here's what's happening. We had a family meeting and decided that maybe you deserve another chance. I hope you make the most of it. That said... 
LingFamily_Timed_001=Unfortunately, we're on a bit of a tight schedule with this one. Need it taken care of ASAP. 
LingFamily_Timed_002=Be sure to keep in mind that this job has a firm deadline. Not much wiggle room. 
LingFamily_Timed_003=Make sure to keep an eye on clock when you're out there. Don't want you missing the deadline. 
LingFamily_Timed_004=Make sure to be mindful of the time while you're working. Our business depends on us being punctual. 
LingFamily_UGF_collect_desc_001=Hey,\n\nWe need you to grab a delivery for us over at ~mission(Location|Address) and then take it to ~mission(Destination|Address).\n\nI was originally going to send my brother Ricki to handle this, but he said the area’s too dangerous. Guess there’s been a bunch of security warnings around there, but as long as you’re careful and bring some guns or whatever, I’m sure you’ll be fine. You probably won’t even run into anything. \n\nThanks, \nConni Ling\nShipment Coordinator\nLing Family Hauling\n

LingFamily_delivery_desc_0004=Hello,\n\nConni normally does these so you'll have to bear with me. Still trying to wrap my head around the system she set up. Believe it or not, I used to handle all of this myself! Thank heavens for Conni though. She's so good at all this stuff. \n\nAnyway, if I'm reading the invoice correctly, the shipment is at ~mission(Location|Address) and needs to be hauled over to ~mission(Destination|Address). Simple enough. \n\nGood luck out there. Make the Ling family proud!\n\n-Davi Ling\nProprietor \nLing Family Hauling

I run a modest security outfit and am always on the lookout for capable people who don't rattle. If you're interested in picking up some extra work, we should talk. I'll send my details.
MilesEckhart_IntroInPersonLawful_1,P=Hey there, sport. Grab a seat. Sorry for the locale, don't look like much but the homemade stuff has some kick. Anyway, I've been hearing good things about you. Real stand-up sort. Just the type of people I like to know.

MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipOnASeriesOfLocations_1,P=It's a basic escort mission, the client's got a handful of stops they need to make. You follow and keep them out of trouble. Not too tough, right?
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareForAssaultLocationsMustBeVagueStationCommArrayServiceStationOutpost_1,P=We've gotten word that an assault's building against some honest-to-god law-abiding folks and they need some help. Pay's not great, but hey, it's not always about the money, right? I'm kidding.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareToAttackLocationsMustBeVagueStationServiceStationAsteroidField_1,P=We've got a target that we need to take down. I've coordinated with local law and bounty hunters so it's totally above board. Anyway, you aren't going to be able to take them in a stand up fight, so you'll need to trap them.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareToAttackLocationsMustBeVagueStationServiceStationAsteroidField_2,P=Got another scumbag who's ready for the swift hand of justice... and worth a sizeable bounty. Up for another ambush?
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustHelpAShipKillOtherShipsWhilstKeepingTheEscortedShipAlive_1,P=Here's the deal, I've managed to secure a retainer for local law enforcement agencies. I just got word that they're moving on some criminal elements and want some backup.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustTakeAnNpcAboardAndDeliverHimToALocationSafely_2,P=Another chaffeur job just came across the spec. Have a look and see if you're interested.
MilesEckhart_LawfulRecoverStolenCargoGuardedByCriminals_2,P=Law enforcement and Advocacy have been cracking down on cargo theft across the systems and are paying operators for the safe retrieval of stolen cargo. Anyway, I put the squeeze on a couple local scumbags and got a line on some hot merch in the area.
MilesEckhart_LawfulSearchAWreckForCorpseOrEvidence_1,P=This job's a retrieval op. Need to collect a special bit of- let's say "salvage." I'm gonna give you the honor of going to the wreck, and finding it.
MilesEckhart_MissionFail_6,P=The whole thing's gone div and I'm left holding the stick. Hope you're proud of yourself. 
MilesEckhart_OncePlayerSits_1,P=So... don't look like much, do ya? Just kidding. So here's my boilerplate pitch, Eckhart Security handles escorts, VIP protection, hostile extractions and even some militia work when they can afford us. Anyway, a job came in late last night. Some idiot hauler thought it'd be a good idea to shave some flight time by cutting through low-sec space and got his crew vented. Company needs to retrieve the ship's blackbox to claim insurance on the lost cargo. Should be a romper job: get in, get out, but all my people are tied up with bigger ops, so I figured I could use this as a chance to make a new friend. I'll send the details, look them over on your own time and if you're interested, hit me back.
MilesEckhart_RepUI_Association=Eckhart Security
MilesEckhart_RepUI_Biography=After leaving the Army, Miles Eckhart missed the excitement of his former life and decided to try mercenary work. He took to it so well that before long he started his own company, Eckhart Security. Specializing in operations in unclaimed and hostile systems like Nyx, Miles remains fully independent and unaffiliated with the Mercenary Guild.
MilesEckhart_RepUI_Location=Lorville, Hurston, Stanton System
MilesEckhart_RepUI_Occupation=CEO, Security Consultant
MilesEckhart_RevisitYoureCurrentlyOnAMission_2,P=You got the details, so get moving.
MilesEckhart_SitsInTheCornerOfTheDarkBarHePerksUpWhenHeSeesYou_1,P=Hey! Over here. How you been? Grab a seat. Come on. Get in here....
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulAtPrisonHard_2,P=Got a dangerous one for you. Probably the less I talk about it the better.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulAtSecurityPost_1,P=Seems one of our clients has been picked up by some two-bit security outfit who fancy themselves real do-gooders. Anyway, our enterprise doesn't benefit with this client incarcerated, so I need you to get them out.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulAtSecurityPost_3,P=I swear, I don't know how some of these idiots have stayed alive long enough to make enough money to keep us on retainer. Anyway, we've got another client cooling their heels in a low-sec clink. You free to boost them?
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulKillInnocentOrRivalCriminal_3,P=Hey killer, feel like earning some extra creds? Got another target that's living on borrowed breath.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksSurroundedByPirates_2,P=Since they're in the stealing mood, I figure no one will mind if we help ourselves. If they do, I trust you'll handle them.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksToInvestigate_1,P=Clients are looking for someone to track down some ships they lost. I don't know if they're trying to retrieve evidence before the law does or what. To be honest, I didn't ask.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustDeliverOnemultiplePackageInAGivenTime_1,P=Contact of mine just hit me up. He's got some product he needs moved quick and quiet. I'm talking invisible here, no scans, no checkpoints. You get pinched with this, you're on your own.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustDeliverOnemultiplePackages_2,P=Need some low profile product that needs to be moved. I'd skirt any heavy security scans if you get my meaning.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustDropOffABomb_2,P=Exciting news, slick. Something needs blowing up, and you get to be the lucky one to do it. 
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustDropOffAndPickUpItems_2,P=So one of my shakier clients is a little nervous and wants us to handle a hand-off. You give 'em ours. We take theirs. And if they try anything... well, you take care of it.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipFromAToB_2,P=You free for another protection op? Got a client who needs a heavy hitter on their wing.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipOnASeriesOfLocations_2,P=You got time for an escort op? It's another staggered one so you'll hit multiple spots. Have a look.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustFindOnemultipleItemsByScavengingOrKillingAndLootingNoHelpIsGivenFindingTheItems_1,P=Got a retrieval op for you. Now, you should know that the owners of the items in question are going to be resistent to the idea of giving up their cargo. I trust you'll be able to change their mind.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareForAssaultLocationsMustBeVagueStationCommArrayServiceStationOutpost_2,P=So one of my more - lets say verbal - clients has apparently pissed off the wrong people. Needs some protection and defenses laid down to help in case they retaliate. Hoping you could handle it.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareToAttackLocationsMustBeVagueStationServiceStationAsteroidField_2,P=Got another name that needs to be marked off. I've worked out the time and place for the ambush, just need a trigger to do the deed.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustHelpAShipKillOtherShipsWhilstKeepingTheEscortedShipAlive_2,P=It's another muscle job, back up the client and shoot up whoever they want shot up.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustTakeAnNpcAboardAndDeliverHimToALocationSafely_2,P=Got another passenger that's looking for low profile transport.

MissionManager_KillCommTechs_Description=So, it seems that Aciedo hasn’t really appreciated their comm arrays ‘mysteriously’ shutting off, and in a move I am sure they are going to come to regret, they’ve decided to start hiring technicians to reactivate the uplinks. That’s really not going to work for us. \n\nWe’ve really come to appreciate all the peace and quiet in the area, and want to keep it that way.   \n\nWith your people skills being what they are, I was hoping that maybe you could convince these techs to leave well enough alone. In the permanent sort of way.\n\nAnd for all your trouble, there’ll be a small thank you gift for each Aciedo tech you put an end to.\n\nHave a great day,\n\n-Ruto

NB_IceSculpture_Name=Sublimate
NB_Plant_Desc_001=Created to be able to survive in near no-light conditions. The resulting altered chlorophyll structure gives the plant its dark coloring and unique woven-like texture. It is hoped that this research will help populate worlds with long night cycles.
NB_Plant_Desc_002=Related to the colocasia, this plant features enormous broad leaves that are pliable and water resistant making it an ideal plastic substitute on remote worlds. Additionally, its sprawling root structure is an edible starch when cooked.
NB_Plant_Desc_003=Derived from a Xi'an desert plant, the many ridges along its trunk are ideal for capturing early morning dew in arid climates. The internal storage cells can collect up to a gallon of drinking water a day in the right conditions.
NB_Plant_Desc_004=The unique fractal structure of the violet curcuma's leaves help convert shorter light-waves into a frequency more suitable for photosynthesis. This allows it to flourish in systems where stars are in the later stages of their life and not producing ideal growth light. Its rhizomes also have culinary and medical uses.
NB_Plant_Desc_005=The unique leaves of this palm variant show a huge leap in bio-engineering possibilities thanks to their meticulously designed aerodynamic structure that allows the plant to endure hurricane strength winds.
NB_Plant_Desc_006=This carnivorous plant catches insects with the sticky resin it secretes, allowing it to not only act as an exterminator for unwanted pests, but also survive in severely nitrogen depleted soil.
NB_Plant_Desc_007=The closely woven structure of the Haldor lily provides it with extreme strength and durability. Suitable for planets plagued with torrential storms or swarming insects, this lily is one of the hardier plants ever fabricated.
NB_Plant_Desc_008=With a strong, thin trunk, the sky palm was designed to grow on worlds with thicker atmospheres where it would be able to collect more of the available sunlight at high elevations.
NB_Plant_Desc_009=The thick trunk of this barrel palm tree is able to hold considerable moisture drawn in from the soil offering a possible water conservation solution to settlers living in arid climates.
NB_Plant_Desc_010=The weaver palm was designed to produce a renewable, strong, lightweight, and flexible material that would serve a variety of purposes for settlers of a new world. Low maintenance and hardy, the plant can grow successfully in a variety of conditions.
NB_Plant_Desc_011=The designers of this plant wanted to protect it from as many herbivore tactics as possible to ensure that its harvest could reach full maturity undisturbed while leaving it non-toxic. The spikes along the trunk makes climbing difficult, the bark appears diseased and dead, and the leaves contain barbed alkaloids that cause extreme pain with skin contact. DO NOT TOUCH.
NB_Plant_Desc_012=Designed to be grown in wet soil and marshland, the dracaena pura acts as a natural aquifer, cleaning water as it passes through its root system. The height of the plant helps it distribute the pollutants it collects to a lower toxicity level to which it can successfully cope.
NB_Plant_Desc_013=When worlds are first being settled, high winds can be a serious issue until enough plant life can take hold. The grand flabellum with its wide leaf structure and deep root system act as erosion breaks helping to protect more delicate plants and structures.
NB_Plant_Desc_014=The leaves of this plant were crafted by engineers to excrete an oil that serves as a natural insect repellent. It is hoped that by planting it in symbiosis with other more valuable crops that it can serve as a deterrent to harmful pests.
NB_Plant_Desc_015=Created to help alleviate symptoms caused by other airborne allergens, the pollen from the flight-of-fancy's bright flowers is a natural antihistamine and is capable of blocking histamine receptors. As a bonus, its large broad leaves provide ample shade making them ideal to plant near habitat areas.
