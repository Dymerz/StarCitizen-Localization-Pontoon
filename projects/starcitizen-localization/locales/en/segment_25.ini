PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereLiaison=Hey there. Liaison Officer Vanzant with Crusader Security. I'm the one managing your contract with us to - says here, "Destroy Illegal Contraband." Ah, right. Basically, criminals have been setting up these automated production facilities that can just keep turning out product like its nothing. We got coordinates on one of these sites, and we want you to go destroy all the contraband they make. We even got a nice little bonus scheme set up where we'll pay you based on how much product you manage to take off the market. You'll be doing good for the community, and getting a good salary to do it. Nothing wrong with that, right?
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HiImYour=Hi, I'm your Crusader Security Liaison Officer for this contract. That means I'll be supervising while you deal with this automated facility. You should have the details, but the idea is that you'll infiltrate the compound and destroy the packages as they come off the production line, preventing them from getting out into the wild. While the manufacturing process takes care of itself, I wouldn't be surprised if you run into some outlaw resistance anyway. Go in prepared, and you should come out alright. Good luck.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyLiaisonOfficer=Hey, Liaison Officer Vanzant here. Thanks for agreeing to help us deal with this illegal production facility. Crusader Security is very eager to make sure that whatever products are coming off the line don't make it onto market. Once you're on site, deal with whatever resistance there is, and destroy as much of the contraband as you can. Ideally all of it. I sent you the details so you should be all set to go. Safe flying.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HiThisIs=Hi, this is Liaison Officer Vanzant with Crusader Security. I'll be overseeing your contract with us. Appreciate your help in dealing with this illegal production facility. As outlined, the hope is that you'll be able to secure the site and confiscate any contraband you find for delivery to our evidence hold. Now, these so-called criminal geniuses have managed to automate a lot of the production, so its unclear how long they'll be manufacturing product for or how many outlaws will be on site, but I'd go in ready to face some serious resistance. Could get pretty nasty... Sure you'll be fine though. I'll check in on you later.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_GreetingsImA=Greetings. I'm a Liaison Officer with Crusader Security and I'll be supervising your work in helping us deal with this illegal production facility today. It's one of the newer automated style where it's pretty much hands free for the outlaws. Crazy how advanced these things are getting. We'd like you to go there and secure as many of the crates of contraband as you can and bring them to us for processing and disposal. And of course, if there any hostile forces present, you're expected to deal with them as appropriate. And remember, caution is the keyword all around.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyThereCrusader=Hey there. Crusader Security Officer Vanzant comming you about the contract work. Just wanted to make sure everything was clear. You're going to be headed to an automated production facility and grabbing all the contraband that comes off the line. Once you have it secured, you're to bring them to the appointed location so we can properly analyze and dispose of it. Not sure what exactly you can expect in terms of hostile resistance, but it usually pays to be ready for a fight. And just to say it, I'm really happy we hired you for this. Will be great to get all this contraband off the market before it does any damage.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_ExpVet_IG_001_HiThereLiaison=Hi there. Liaison Officer Vanzant. Happy to see you'll be helping Crusader Security out with this contract.

I'm updating the details for you now but it should all be pretty clear. Just remember to keep your head down and be safe. Don't want to lose anybody on my watch. All right, get to it and I'll check in on you later.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_HeyCommingYou=Hey, comming you on behalf of Crusader Security. I'll be supervising your current contract with us. All the details have been forwarded so hopefully that covers everything you need to get started. I'll check in with you periodically, but until then, good luck and be safe.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_HeyThereThis=Hey there, this is Crusader Security Liaison Officer Vanzant comming about the contract. I'll be your point of contact on this job but it should hopefully be straightforward. You have all details so feel free to get going right away. Just make sure to stock up on any supplies you'll need. Nothing worse than being caught unprepared. Good luck.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Announce_Dropoff_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyItsOfficer=Hey, it's Officer Vanzant again. Just wanted to pass along that the Crusader Security personnel on patrol in your sector have been notified that you're delivering some contraband to our evidence hold for us. You shouldn't run into any problem as you make your way there. At least from us. There's probably a few outlaws out there who'd like to get their product back. Actually, might be a good idea for you make the delivery as fast as you can. Won't be safe flying around too long with this stuff.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Announce_Dropoff_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyThereOfficer=Hey there. Officer Vanzant. Wanted to let you know that I notified the local patrols that you'd be heading through the sector. Didn't want them to be surprised when a ship carting a bunch of contraband turned up. Also told them to keep an eye out for anybody who might be trying to get their hands on that stash you're hauling. Hopefully you won't have any trouble on your way to the drop off.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Announce_Dropoff_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HiLiaisonOfficer=Hi, Liaison Officer Vanzant here. Didn't want you to run into any trouble on your way to the evidence hold, so I've gone ahead and alerted Crusader Security patrols in the area that you're authorized to be traveling with contraband aboard. Should make things easier for you. Now all you have to do is avoid any outlaws trying to take their drugs back and you'll be fine.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_SoJustGot=So, just got a tip hot off the wire. Seems these perps didn?t like us interfering and the site's been ordered offline. Since, they won't be producing any more contraband, destroy whatever's left before heading off.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_WantedToPass=Wanted to pass along an update. The production line's going to be shutting down. Guess these bastards decided to count their losses or lick their wounds or whatever. Go ahead and finish destroying whatever contraband is still on site and then we should be all set.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyGotA=Hey, got a report from an informant that the production line's going dark. They probably figured there's no point in making more if we're just going to destroy all of it. Speaking of, finishing destroying whatever you can find left down there and then you're good to clear out.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyOneOf=Hey, one of our contacts just let us know that the people operating the site got word of our operation and ordered it to go dark. Collect whatever you can, and bring it to the evidence hold. It's not worth you hanging around there longer than you have to.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyIfThis=Hey, if this report I got is right, that production line should be shutting down any moment now. Finish collecting whatever contraband you can get your hands on and go ahead and bring it to the drop off.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_SoLooksLike=So, looks like they're going to be deactivating the production line at the sight. Guess the criminals finally got word of what we were up to. Since their won't be any more contraband coming off the line, finish collecting whatever there is and bring it to the evidence hold. Thanks.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BadPerformance_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_OfficerVanzantHere=Officer Vanzant here. I was rooting for you, but with your performance I have no choice but to unfortunately terminate your contract. Sorry, it didn't work out.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BadPerformance_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_LookImGonna=Look, I'm gonna give it to you straight. You just weren't up to snuff this time around. Nothing you can't overcome with a bit of a hard work and practice, but for now I'm going to have to terminate the contract. Hopefully things turn around for you soon.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BadPerformance_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeySoFrom=Hey. So from what I'm seeing your performance isn't up to Crusader Security standards. Gonna go ahead and cancel your contract. Guess you just weren't the right person for this job, huh?
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BadPerformance_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_ThisIsOfficer=This is Officer Vanzant again. It's not good. Your performance has been sub-par and I'm canceling the contract. Nothing personal. Have a good one, okay.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BadPerformance_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_AllRightTheres=All right, there's no easy way to say this, but I'm terminating your contract. Your performance just wasn't meeting our requirements for this job. That's it. Good luck out there.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BreaksContract_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_GeezWhatAre=Geez, what are you thinking? That just because you're working for us you can break the law? That's not how it works, buddy. Contract's canceled, and you can forget about working with Crusader Security until you get your life sorted.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BreaksContract_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_AmIReading=Am I reading this right? Did you actually get a crimestat while working as a security contractor? Talk about not knowing which way your feet are facing. It goes without saying, but we can't have an active criminal on the payroll, so you're fired. Good luck with your legal problems.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BreaksContract_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyNotSure=Hey, not sure what the hell happened, but an active crimestat means you can't work for Crusader Security. I gotta cut you loose. Contract's over.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BreaksContract_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_LookIfWe=Look, if we knew you were going to be out there breaking the law, Crusader Security never would have hired you in the first place. That crimestat means you're terminated. That's just how it is.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BreaksContract_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_DidYouSeriously=Did you seriously just get a crimestat? I know things can get tricky out there but I expected you to be more careful than this. Whatever happened, I'm gonna have to cut you loose. Crusader Security doesn't employ criminals. All right, contract's terminated.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_IllegalKiosk_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_WoahYoureGoing=Woah, you're going around selling this stuff? I can't believe you'd betray our trust like that. You can forget about the contract. Hell, you can forget about working for Crusader again for a very long time.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_IllegalKiosk_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyDidYou=Hey! Did you actually think selling the illegal contraband we hired you to collect was a good idea? Unbelievable! You are so fired. I can't even comprehend what was going through your mind. You know what, I don't care. I'm done with you.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_IllegalKiosk_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_IDidntWant=I didn't want to believe it at first, but I can't argue with the evidence. I can't believe you'd stab me in the back like this. Do you have any idea what kind of damage that contraband you sold will do to the community? Forget it. There's no point in talking to someone like you.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_NotPlayerFault_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyHateTo=Hey, hate to do this, but it seems that Crusader Security isn't going to need your help on this contract after all. Don't worry though. This won't reflect on you at all. Next contract, we'd be happy to have you back. Safe flying until then.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_NotPlayerFault_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyCommingWith=Hey, comming with a bit of bad news. I have to close out the contract. You didn't do anything wrong, it?s just the higher ups have decided our resources will be better spent elsewhere. Apologies. Hopefully this won't happen again.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_NotPlayerFault_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyItsVanzant=Hey, it's Vanzant. Wanted to let you know that I have to cancel the contract. It's not your fault in the slightest, just one of those things. Crap luck really. Anyway, hopefully we'll have another job for you soon and we can make it up to you. All right. Have a good one.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_NotPlayerFault_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_HeyReallyHate=Hey, really hate to do this to you, but I'm canceling the contract. The situation's changed and we won't be needing you after all. Hope you're not too mad. Would love to have you on another job in the future. Okay. Sorry again.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_NotPlayerFault_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_OkayDontShoot=Okay, don't shoot the messenger here, but Crusader Security is terminating this contract. Nothing you did. It just happens sometimes and you unfortunately got the short straw. Hopefully, next time you work with us things will go smoother.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_ListenUpThis=Listen up. This is Security Officer Vanzant and it is my obligation to hereby notify you that due to breach of contract, your employment is hereby terminated.

PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Inform_Mission_StatusUpdate_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyHopeIm=Hey, hope I'm not interrupting anything. Had gotten a status update on your progress and wanted to say that it seems you're more or less on target. Just keep doing what you've been doing and we'll be all set.

PU_DARNEELY_MG_MissionBriefs_Salvage_Find_IG_003_IReceivedAnother=I received another tip about some salvage. Sadly, they were not as forthcoming about exactly where it could be found.
PU_DARNEELY_MG_MissionBriefs_Salvage_Generic_IG_001_IHaveReceived=I have received word that there is salvage to be had. Very exciting, I know.
PU_DARNEELY_MG_MissionBriefs_Salvage_Generic_IG_002_IRequireThe=I require the retrieval of some salvage. If you are willing, you shall go fetch it.
PU_DARNEELY_MG_MissionBriefs_Salvage_Investigate_IG_001_IHaveSeveral=I have several confidants within Hurston Security who notify me when conflicts have been 'resolved' around the planet. They have no interest in salvaging the wreckage themselves, but pass along the location to me, for a nice cut of the sale.
PU_DARNEELY_MG_MissionBriefs_Salvage_Investigate_IG_002_AnotherDayAnother=Another day, another cluster of opportunity. I have received a list of potential salvage sites and if you agree, they shall be yours for the taking.
PU_DARNEELY_MG_MissionBriefs_Salvage_Pirates_IG_001_SecurityWereJust=Security were just notified of a battle going on this very moment. They aren't going to intervene until the conflict is resolved, but I was thinking it might be beneficial to get up there before anyone else does. There might still be some aggressors in the area... but that shouldn't be a problem for someone like you, right?
PU_DARNEELY_MG_MissionBriefs_Salvage_Pirates_IG_003_IMayKnow=I may know of some very fresh salvage. Unfortunately, you might have to battle your way to it. Thrilling, yes?
PU_DARNEELY_MG_MissionBriefs_Steal_Generic_IG_001_IfYoureNot=If you're not particularly concerned with shades of morality, I may have a lead on some... well, let's just call it questionable materials in need of forceful collection.
PU_DARNEELY_MG_MissionBriefs_Steal_Generic_IG_002_IOftenFind=I often find people are too preoccupied with material concerns. I own this and you own that. Who is to say who owns what? I mean, if you were to bring me some salvage, woudn't that technically make it ours? Even if someone else said it was there's?
PU_DARNEELY_MG_MissionBriefs_Steal_Retrieve_IG_001_FeelFreeTo=Feel free to say no, but a little bird gave me the location of some unfortunates who have been attacking convoys heading through the system. Now, should you eliminate them, it seems like that would produce some salvageable materials, no?
PU_DARNEELY_MG_MissionBriefs_Steal_Retrieve_IG_003_TruthBeTold=Truth be told, I have been in dire need of some very specific salvage. Dire enough to encourage you to go ahead and create the salvage yourself.
PU_DARNEELY_MG_Mission_Farewell_MissionAccepted_IG_001_ExcellentGoodLuck=Excellent. Good luck on your charge and I will speak to you soon.

PU_DARNEELY_MG_Mission_Greetings_NoLonger_IG_002_IHaventA=I haven't a single thing I wish to discuss with you. Good day.
PU_DARNEELY_MG_Mission_Greetings_StillMission_IG_001_TimeIsFleeting=Time is fleeting and unfortunately, so is your charge. Perhaps you should expedite things.
PU_DARNEELY_MG_Mission_Greetings_StillMission_IG_004_WhatAreYou=What are you doing here? Off you go. There's no time to waste.
PU_DARNEELY_MG_Mission_Greetings_WrongDelivery_IG_002_IBelieveYou=I believe you are mistaken. That doesn't come here.
PU_DARNEELY_MG_Mission_Greetings_WrongDelivery_IG_003_ImNotQuite=I'm not quite sure what you expect me to do with that. I suggest you take it to a more suitable destination.
PU_DARNEELY_MG_MultipleMissionOffer_IG_001_IAmSimply=I am simply overwhelmed with the prospects of employment. Far too many to keep track of. Let me know if you may alleviate me.

PU_DARNEELY_MG_Transition_CommentToGiving_IG_002_ButISuppose=But I suppose that hearing an old man's opinions was not the real focus of your visit, correct?
PU_DARNEELY_MG_Transition_CommentToGiving_IG_003_ButLetUs=But let us move on, shall we...

PU_ECKHART_MG_Intro_PlayerSits_V_WP_Bad_004_IfImWrong=If I'm wrong, we can leave it at that. Enjoy a drink in my spectacular company for a few minutes then we'll part ways with the understanding that this meeting never happened.
PU_ECKHART_MG_Intro_PlayerSits_V_WP_Bad_005_IfImRight=But if I'm right, then I might just have a gig that I could use you for.
