civilian_localdelivery_holiday_desc_001=Happy Luminalia!\n\nI have a huge favor to ask. Thanks to some very ill timed maintenance issues, my ship is out of commission for at least a week and I won't be able to finish delivering presents to everyone on my gift list.\n\nLooked into using FTL but with their holiday pricing I'll end up paying more credits than what the gifts cost! \n\nFigured I would see if you're interested in helping me out. I get my gifts delivered on time and you get some extra Luminalia spending credits. \n\nThe three gifts are wrapped and waiting at  ~mission(Pickup1|Address). One is for ~mission(GiftRecipient1|First) over at ~mission(DropOff1), another's for ~mission(GiftRecipient2|First) at ~mission(DropOff2), and the last one is for ~mission(GiftRecipient3|First) who's at ~mission(DropOff3).\n\nThanks in advance and may your light glow a little brighter this year!\n\nSincerely,\n~mission(GiftSender|First)
civilian_localdelivery_holiday_desc_002=I'm in desperate need of a little Luminalia magic and I hope you're the one to help.\n\nThere are three gifts stuck at  ~mission(Pickup1|Address) that need to be delivered. \n\nI tried scheduling a pick up but just got notified that they won't be able to make it until after the holidays. Would you be able to take care of the deliveries for me? I'll gladly pay you what I was going to give them.\n\nIt shouldn't be too hard. One is for ~mission(GiftRecipient1) over at ~mission(DropOff1), another's for ~mission(GiftRecipient2) at ~mission(DropOff2), and the last one is for ~mission(GiftRecipient3) who's at ~mission(DropOff3).\n\nWhatever you decide to help or not, I hope you have a very happy holiday!\n\n- ~mission(GiftSender)
civilian_localdelivery_holiday_desc_003=Hope the holiday season is treating you well.\n\nMine's been a bit stressful so far. It turns out that I put the wrong delivery address on a handful of gifts and I'm desperately seeking a way to get them delivered on time. \n\nIt would mean so much to me if you could get me out of this jam. \n\nThe presents are at  ~mission(Pickup1|Address) and will need to be delivered to: \n- ~mission(GiftRecipient1) at ~mission(DropOff1)\n- ~mission(GiftRecipient2) at ~mission(DropOff2)\n- ~mission(GiftRecipient3) at ~mission(DropOff3).\n\nThank you and best holiday wishes,\n~mission(GiftSender)
civilian_localdelivery_holiday_desc_004=I know things get busy around the holidays, but I was reaching out to see if you had any extra time to do a delivery run.\n\nGot a few presents at ~mission(Pickup1|Address)  for close friends that I won't be able to deliver myself. \nYou would need to take one to ~mission(GiftRecipient1) at ~mission(DropOff1), another to ~mission(GiftRecipient2) at ~mission(DropOff2), and the last to ~mission(GiftRecipient3) at ~mission(DropOff3).\n\nMuch appreciated,\n~mission(GiftSender)

commarray_hack_danger_0003=I'm not expecting trouble, but knowing what security is like in that sector, it's not out of the question.Â 
commarray_hack_danger_0004=If I'm being honest, these ~mission(Client) had one of their own try to handle the array, and they got taken out. Just don't let the same thing happen to you. Go in prepared, you should come out fine.Â 
commarray_hack_desc=~mission(Description)
commarray_hack_desc_0001=A couple of ~mission(Client) are working on a big score and they need ~mission(MissionLocation|Address) shut down to make sure they get some privacy. Once it's offline, we'll need you to hang out there to make sure the commlink stays down long enough. ~mission(Danger)\n\nAnd DON'T forget, you'll need a CRYPTOKEY to access the array's controls. \nBring your own if you want, but you can head to ~mission(Location|Address) and grab one there.\nHate for you to head all the way out to the array and not be able to do the damn job.
commarray_hack_desc_0002=~mission(MissionLocation|Address) being online's going to be a problem for some ~mission(Client) working the area. \nShut it down, keep it offline 'til the job's complete, and we'll make it worth your while. ~mission(Danger)\n\nOf course, you won't be able to access the array's controls unless you have a CRYPTOKEY with you. \nWe arranged for one to be waiting for you at ~mission(Location|Address) if you don't already have one.Â 
commarray_hack_desc_0003=I don't want to get too specific, but let's just say it would be better for everyone if someone could make sure that ~mission(MissionLocation|Address) was taken out of commission and that it stayed that way for a while. ~mission(Danger)\n\nAnd I shouldn't have to mention this, but for the love of everything, bring a CRYPTOKEY with you. Last thing we need is you showing up unprepared. \nActually, you know what, if you don't already have one, there's a cryptokey at ~mission(Location|Address) that you can use.
commarray_hack_desc_0004=Certain ~mission(Client) have a job in the works, but they can't do it as long as the ~mission(MissionLocation|Address) is still online. Need a systems-grok to disable the comm uplink, and stay onsite long enough to make sure there aren't any issues. ~mission(Danger) Credits on completion. No up-front.Â \n\n---> REMINDER: Bring a CRYPTOKEY with you to hack the array's controls. Either grab one from ~mission(Location|Address) or bring your own.
commarray_hack_desc_0005=Here's the breakdown -Â  ~mission(MissionLocation|Address) needs to be taken offline, and ~mission(Client) are looking to hire a hacker to do it and guarantee the uplink's down for as long as needed. ~mission(Danger)That's about all you need to know.\n\n*** P.S.

confirmkill_desc_0002=I keep telling people you gotta vet before you hire, but do they listen? Course not. Take the ~mission(Client) for example.

confirmkill_desc_0003=Another job of mine was supposed to be all wrapped up, but now the ~mission(Client) are worried that ~mission(TargetName) might still be upright.

confirmkill_desc_0006=Hope you don't mind corpses, cause I need you to get up close and personal with one. Used to go by the name ~mission(TargetName).

covalexrand_desc_0001=Been waiting forever for Covalex to get their act together after the accident they had, but I just don't think it's going to happen at this point. Hoping you could go out to Gundo and grab my order for me. ~mission(Reference)~mission(Timed)I don't need you to take it all the way to me either. I arranged for shipment from ~mission(Destination) so all you'd have to do is leave it there at the front desk for me.\n\nThanks,\n~mission(Owner)
covalexrand_desc_0002=I had an important shipment with Covalex and apparently it was waiting at Gundo when they had that big accident there. They said the delivery was going to be delayed, but it's been months now and they're still telling me the same exact thing. No new information or anything. I'm losing a ton of money on this and the best they can offer me is an apology. Not good enough. Figure if they can't finish the delivery, I'll find someone who can. ~mission(Reference) Need it delivered to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0003=Hey, a gift I ordered is stuck out on that Covalex station that exploded or whatever and now they say they can't deliver it. I'm really sorry about what happened there, but I already missed our anniversary and if I miss their birthday too, I'm gonna be dead. Basically, I need that box to be at ~mission(Destination) by any means necessary. ~mission(Reference) ~mission(Timed) 
covalexrand_desc_0004=Look, we can all agree it was a real tragedy what happened out there at Gundo, and I'm sorry people lost their lives, but that doesn't mean I don't need my package delivered, right? And if Covalex isn't willing or able to do it, then I have every right to go and get delivered on my own. That only seems fair. ~mission(Reference)If you're interested, I'll need it taken to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)\n\nGood luck,\n~mission(Owner)
covalexrand_desc_0005=I'm in a bit of a bind. A delivery I've been expecting was rerouted through Covalex's Gundo station out near Crusader, but an accident there stopped all shipments. I tried getting a refund, but the company I ordered from says it's Covalex's fault, and Covalex says that their terms of service covers a delay like this. ~mission(Timed)I guess at this point I just want my package and I don't really care how I get it. Even to the point where I'm willing to pay the extra shipping to have someone just take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. ~mission(Reference)
covalexrand_desc_0006=I need someone with access to a ship to fly out to Covalex's Gundo station and take a box there to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Reference)And before you get the wrong idea or anything, I'm not talking about stealing or anything, because it's my package. Covelex is just dragging their feet delivering it because of the investigation or safety or whatever excuse they're using. ~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0007=A package I ordered is stuck because of the accident that happened at Gundo. I paid good creds for this and now it's just sitting there gathering dust. Seems to me that if Covalex isn't gonna do anything about it, then I might as well pay someone to find it and take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. ~mission(Reference)~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0008=I am going crazy. Covalex keeps telling me that they delivered my package, but I didn't get it. The last routing information I have places it at their Gundo center, so I'm thinking that it got misplaced when they had the big accident there. ~mission(Item) If you could go check it out, I bet you anything that it's just sitting there. ~mission(Reference)If it is there, I'll pay to have you bring it to ~mission(Destination).

covalexspec_description_0001=Hi,\n\nI'll totally understand if you don't want to help with this, but if you can it would be amazing.\n\nSee, my boyfriend passed away during the Covalex Gundo tragedy. They said I would get all of Scott's stuff back once the investigation was complete, but as far as I know, it's been done for a while now and they still haven't given any indication of when I can get his property. It's been hard enough dealing with all this, and knowing that a package is going to show up in a month or two and rip open all these wounds, it's just too much. I would prefer to deal with it now and get it over with. If you could find a way to get his personal effects (Employee ID# 104) and drop them off at ~mission(Destination), I'd be very grateful.\n\nThanks for your help,\nAnya
covalexspec_description_0002=My brother was one of those people who died when that Covalex station near Crusader blew. Even worse, he was borrowing something of mine when it happened. Now some red tape asshole is trying to tell me that I have to wait to get my stuff back. Yeah right. First you kill my brother and now you want me to be patient? The nerve of these corporate jillos. Forget that. Instead, I figured I'd hire someone to go to Gundo to get my stuff and take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. I mean, what the hell are they gonna do about it? Anyway, it's what my brother would have wanted. It's gonna be the box marked 156.\n\n- Ed
covalexspec_description_0003=Hey,\n\nSo this is a little awkward for me to talk about, but it turns out that one of the people who passed away on that Covalex station disaster, Kyomi Santos, actually bequeathed me something in her will. I was surprised to hear it, but apparantly I'm now the proud owner of everything stored in box #173. The people at Covalex say I'll be able to get it when the station opens back up but ... this is the awkward part ... I kind of really need it right now. Normally I'd just wait, but I'm trying to start my own business (I make cakes in the shape of people's homeworlds) and the credits I get from selling it will really be a huge help. I've got a little bit stashed away now that I can use to pay for someone to deliver it from Gundo to ~mission(Destination) for me. I know the whole things a little bit irregular, but if there was any other way I wouldn't be asking.\n\nThanks for the help,\nThrace
covalexspec_description_0004=My son Nico was sadly among the victims of the tragic accident at Covelex's Gundo station and they still haven't returned all of his personal possessions to me. I understand that they have to do things according to regulations, but it seems unconscionable that they wouldn't make some allowances for the grieving family members. To that end, I'm seeking someone who will be able to go to the station for me. To be clear, Gundo is currently considered off limits, meaning that this would not be above board, but I feel my situation warrants special consideration. My sister says that the rate I am offering is the correct amount for retrieving the crate with Nico's belongings (#964) and bringing them to ~mission(Destination), so hopefully I can find a competent individual to settle this matter quickly.\n\nSincerely,\nGloria Theolone
covalexspec_description_0005=They said that I could find someone here to go to Gundo for me and grab a crate that belonged to my wife. If the name didn't ring a bell, that's the station where they had that big accident. My wife worked for Covalex and I know it's not really going to make losing her any easier, but I really just want Claudia's stuff back. I think about her photo collection or the necklace I gave her just sitting there in that cold dead station in some box marked 249 and it's not right. She deserves better. So how about it? You willing to go to Gundo and haul her crate back to ~mission(Destination)?
covalexspec_description_0006=Hi,\n\nI'm looking for someone to head to the Covalex Gundo station near Crusader and grab some items. I know this may sound like stealing, but it's my dad's stuff. You see, he was on Gundo station when it had its accident. My mom says that we need to wait until Covalex says so, but I don't think that's fair because I miss him so much. I would like something to remember him by and I don't want to wait any longer because I might start forgetting things. I'll pay you to get box 510 for me and take to ~mission(Destination) so I can have it.\n\nThank you very much,\nBaylor Ward

criminal_recoverstash_desc_03=A cousin of a friend of mine got shafted by their crew and decided the best way to settle the grudge was to let me know about the stash they have hidden away.

criminal_recoverstash_desc_04=Thank the stars that dumb outlaws will always talk too much when they're hopped up on rot. This one git I was drinking with blabbed about a score they had secreted away in a hidden spot.\n\nFigured we could teach them a lesson about the importance of holding your liquor.\n\nI want you to -\n* go to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation)\n* find their stash\n* bring it back to ~mission(Destination|Address).\n\nThere's a chance this bumbling idiot and their friends might be hold up there too, so be careful.

You're gonna go teach them a lesson for me and get my stuff back.\n\nI want you to -\n* go to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation)\n* find all my stolen stash\n* bring it back to ~mission(Destination|Address).\n\nNot sure if they'll be hanging around when you get there or not, but if you end up coming across these asshats, I'll see you get some extra creds for the hassle.

criminal_recoverstash_steal_desc_01=It pays to keep an ear open, and in this case, it pays very well.\n\nDiscovered where a nice little treasure is being secreted away, and with your help, we can take it for ourselves.\n\nGo to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation) and  find all of the stash hidden there. You may have to hunt around a bit since its probably wont just be sitting out in the open.\n\nOnce you have it all, bring it back to ~mission(Destination|Address) and I'll pay you your cut.\n\nIt's not clear yet if the site is being guarded or not, but we'll know for sure one way or the other once you're there.

criminal_recoverstash_steal_desc_02=You in the mood for a bit of a treasure hunt? \n\nOne of my crew was snatched recently and overhead some other scavs talking about how they had hidden away some pretty choice loot before being locked up. \n\nYou're going to steal it for me.\n\nGo to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation). That's where they stashed the loot. \n\nOnce there, you're on your own to search the area and find where everything is hidden.\n\nAfter you found all of the stash, haul it over to ~mission(Destination|Address). Payment on delivery.\n\nLast thing. Not all of their gang was caught so there still might be a few hanging around. Don't worry though. If they're there, I'll throw some extra creds your way to make it up to you.
criminal_recoverstash_steal_desc_03=Not sure if you've been hearing the rumors, but I think I figured out where that gang that pulled that big score last week hid everything they stole.\n\nIt's just sitting out there while they wait for the heat to die down. Real shame if anything happened to it...\n\nFor example if someone were to go to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation), search around, find where all the stolen loot is, and bring all of it to ~mission(Destination|Address). \n\nBet a person who did something like that would stand to make a lot of credits.\n\nOf course the biggest risk would be if there were guards in the area, but if that were the case, I'm sure a bonus payment would make it worth the trouble.

destroyprobeillegal_desc=~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDescription)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0001=The ~mission(Contractor|Name) are fed up with their ops getting busted near ~mission(Location). Turns out, there's ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) in the area listening in on everything we do. No wonder they keep getting busted. Take care of the problem for them and there's a nice little payday waiting. \n\nJust know that you'll need to scan the area since PDC Monitors like this are a pain in the ass to find and they're programmed to package up their data once they're hit, so knock 'em out quick. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0002=The area around ~mission(Location) has become a huge headache for some associates of mine since security's listening in on anything said or done out there. The ~mission(Contractor|Name) found ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) nearby and need someone special to go hunt down these sneaky little PDC Monitors. They're a real pain in the ass to find, but having to scan the area for them's only half the problem. \n\nOnce you take a shot, boom, they're programmed to shut down and upload their data back to central. You gotta blast them to bits before they finish. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0003=Interested in a little target practice? Head over to ~mission(Location) and turn security's bloody annoying spy monitors into scrap. There's ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) out there and nobody's been able to find the stupid things either since they barely put out a sig while they're collecting data. \n\nAnyway, the entire situation has been particularly frustrating for the ~mission(Contractor|Name), which is why they're paying for someone to scan the area and eliminate the threat. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)One last thing, they're rigged to dump their data when they're shot, so kill 'em quick.
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0004=Not sure if you've heard the rumors but arrests have spiked around ~mission(Location). security's showing up at jobs and sweeping everybody to the clink. Weren't dumb luck either. Cru-Sec was waiting for them. So, I did a little recon and discovered ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) surveilling the area. Plenty of people, including the ~mission(Contractor|Name), want this inconvenience eliminated. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)\n\nI can guarantee good creds and my eternal gratitude if you do it. Hunt down the PDC Monitors by scanning for wherever they're hiding, and attack hard and fast before they get a chance to upload any data they've collected. Once they're gone, we can all get back to good, ol' fashioned criminalizing. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0005=You been by ~mission(Location) recently? ~mission(Contractor|Name) told me that security set up ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) to spy on anyone passing by. I'm not against a little law and order, that's what makes the game the game, but this goes too far. Let's just say that I'm not the only one who shares this sentiment. ~mission(Contractor|Name) are even paying to restore the balance. \n\nThese PDC Monitors are a pain to find so you'll need to scan the area. Plus, when you engage, you'll need to destroy them before they finish uploading all the dirt they've scraped up. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0006=Security thinks they're so smart. They set up ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) near ~mission(Location) to gather intel on the ~mission(Contractor|Name). Didn't take long before someone figured it out. So, feel like getting paid to literally blow up their stupid scheme? All you got to do is be the one to actually scan the area to find where the PDC Monitors are hiding and take 'em out. \n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)Another thing to keep in mind, these things are wired to protect the info they're pulling, so once you shoot, you gotta destroy them all before they can upload all their data.
