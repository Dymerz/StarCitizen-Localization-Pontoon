Dlg_SC_Tutorial_back_to_baseTraining_1460_Training_Complete_Return_To_Base=Let's get you back to base. First round's on me.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_barrel_roll_executedTraining_0440_Flight_Barrel_Roll_Gilly_Executed=Ah... so much fun.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_barrel_roll_explanationTraining_0450_Flight_Barrel_Roll_Explanation=Rolling is a great way to orient your ship to fit through tight gaps or evade incoming fire. Now you give it a go.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_barrel_roll_introTraining_0430_Flight_Barrel_Roll_Intro=Moving on. Now this is my favorite part of training: the barrel roll.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_beckoning_playerTraining_0010_Player_Report_To_Leader=Hey there. Hustle on over.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_boost_alt_useTraining_1090_Flight_Boost_Alt_Use=You can also use it to overpower you manoeuvring thrusters in order to take tighter corners.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_boost_introTraining_1080_Flight_Boost_Explanation=If you need to get up to top speed in a hurry, try boosting.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_chaff_difficultyTraining_0800_Combat_CM_Chaff_Difficulty=Deploying Noise takes more skill than Decoys. To be successful, you need to put it between you and the missile.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_chaff_explanationTraining_0790_Combat_CM_Chaff_Explanation=Good. Now, a Noise creates a cloud of electromagnetic interference to mask your signature from the missile.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_chase_player_dawdles_1Training_0580_Combat_Chase_Player_Dawdles_01=What are you waiting for? Go finish it off.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_chase_player_dawdles_2Training_0580_Combat_Chase_Player_Dawdles_02=Let's go. You're on the clock, rookie.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_autoTraining_0150_Landing_Mode_Auto_Engage_Decoupled=Activating landing mode restricts you to decoupled mode, meaning only your manoeuvring thrusters fire, which is handy for precise movement in tight areas.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_manualTraining_0150_Landing_Mode_Manual_Engage_Decoupled=I've gone ahead and restricted you to decoupled mode, which makes it much easier to position yourself for a launch. In Decoupled Mode, your main engine is disengaged, allowing you to move more precisely using your manoeuvring thrusters.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_modeTraining_0820_Combat_Decoupled_Mode_Intro_01=Remember Decoupled Mode from taking off? If the Drone gets behind you, enter Decoupled mode to disengage your main engines and allow you to spin your ship around while retaining your original vector.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_player_tryTraining_0820_Combat_Decoupled_Mode_Intro_03=Give it a try, just remember to disengage it when you're done.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_reminder_autoTraining_0880_Landing_Mode_Auto_Engage_Decoupled=Remember, entering Landing Mode will automatically Decouple your ship, so don't activate it too far away from the landing pad as it cuts down your speed.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_reminder_manualTraining_0890_Landing_Mode_Manual_Engage_Decoupled=The flight system automatically cuts down on your speed when you deploy the landing gear, so don't activate it too far away from the landing pad.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_deviate_from_landingTraining_0950_Landing_Deviate_From_Landing=If you raise you landing gear or stray too far from the pad, you'll have to request it again.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_disabled_controlsTraining_0070_Cockpit_Intro_02=You'll notice the majority of your systems are disabled. I'll be controlling when they are on and offline to simulate potential scenarios in combat situations.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_doors_openTraining_0110_Take_Off_Doors_Open=Once you're aligned, the tower will open the doors.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_drone_1_introTraining_0470_Combat_Intro_03=Don't worry - it's just a training drone. It handles just like the real thing, but it's weapons are less lethal. Saying that - they still pack a punch so try not to take any hits you don't have to.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_drone_2_killedTraining_0840_Combat_Decoupled_Mode_Player_Kill_Drone=Good kill. We're heading back to the landing pad to restock and refuel for the final part of your training.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_ejects_before_warning_1Training_1410_Self-Destruct_Player_Hit_Eject_Before_Warning=I can't let you eject without initiating self-destruct.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_ejects_before_warning_2Training_1420_Self-Destruct_Player_Eject_Prompt_01=It's the only thing I can't do it remotely, kid. You have to initiate. Hurry.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_ejects_before_warning_3Training_1420_Self-Destruct_Player_Eject_Prompt_02=Your plant's leaking radiation. You need to self-destruct now.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_ejects_before_warning_4Training_1420_Self-Destruct_Player_Eject_Prompt_03=Hit self-destruct, now!

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_flare_explanationTraining_0740_Combat_CM_Flare_Explanation=Last missile was heat-seeking so equip your flares. Helpful tip, don't boost after dropping a flare. Boosted thrusters are much hotter than a flare.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_flare_launch_successTraining_0770_Combat_CM_Flare_Launch_Good=Good.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_free_lookTraining_0070_Cockpit_Intro_01=Alright. First thing's first, take a look around your cockpit and familiarise yourself with the layout. It's imperative to quickly find and access specific controls. Last thing you want to be doing in a scrap is bringing up the instructions.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_glaive_defeatedTraining_1360_Combat_Vanduul_Glaive_Defeated=Good kill. Glaive's down.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_glaive_idTraining_1330_Combat_Vanduul_Id_Glaive=That Glaive's a recognised Ace, enemy designation is Tank. We're gonna have to work together to take it down.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_gsafe_explanation_2Training_1130_Flight_G-Safe_Explanation_02=That last sharp turn you probably felt your ship clamp down on the turn. That's your G-Safe system kicking in, making sure that you aren't taking too many G-forces and blacking out.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_gsafe_explanation_3Training_1130_Flight_G-Safe_Explanation_03=If you need to get that extra edge in turning, you can disable G-Safe, but be warned. An unconscious pilot turns into a dead one pretty quick.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_match_speed_target_speedTraining_0410_Flight_Match_Speed_Target_Speed_Change=Remember, this isn't autopilot, so you still have to steer, but you'll notice that once you're locked, your computer will continue to monitor my speed and adjust. It doesn't matter if I speed up slowly…

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_multiple_pipTraining_0590_Combat_Hud_Pip_Multiple_Reticles=Notice you have multiple PIPs with varying lag? Each of those indicates a weapon on your ship. The computer's trying to compensate for the varying speeds between your ballistic and energy projectiles.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_new_drone_targetTraining_0710_Combat_New_Drone_Target=Let's move on - uh-oh! Looks like he had a friend. Take a look in your rear-view camera.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_pitch_rollTraining_0160_Take_Off_Pitch_Roll_Warning=Make sure you don't pitch or roll. It'll be tough to get back into proper alignment.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_alignedTraining_0210_Take_Off_Player_Aligned_Doors_Open=The tower will open the doors once you're lined up.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_boards_gilly_ship_1Training_0060_Player_Wrong_Pod_01=Easy there, rookie. That's my ride.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_general_warning_4Training_0370_Flight_Player_General_Warning_04=Stay on track, kid.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_general_warning_5Training_0370_Flight_Player_General_Warning_05=Sharpen up, rookie. This isn't going to cut it.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_no_weaponsTraining_0730_Combat_No_Weapons=That hit took out your weapons. You'll have to hold out until they come back online. Countermeasures are still online. Use them.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_off_centreTraining_0200_Take_Off_Player_Off-Centre=Don't align yourself with the middle of the doors. You'd be surprised how many 'cruits forget that the cockpit is not the centre of the ship.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_strafe_forwardTraining_0180_Take_Off_Player_Move_Forward=Okay. Now strafe forward onto the taxiway. If you need it, the tower should have lit up your path.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_take_offTraining_0170_Take_Off_Player_Dust_Off=Nice, you're clear of the pad.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_ship_checkTraining_0070_Cockpit_Intro_03=Let's get ready for takeoff. I'll do this step by step to show you how it's done. Systems, check. Engines, check. Tower, permission for launch.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_ship_positionTraining_0750_Combat_CM_Ship_Position=Another pro tip: countermeasures are fired backward so never fly at a missile head-on, launch a countermeasure and expect it to work.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_shortcutTraining_1140_Race_Shortcut=Think fast.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_somedamageTraining_0280_Take_Off_Some_Damage=A little shaky, but vertical take-offs take some practice.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_space_brake_introTraining_1110_Flight_Space_Brake_Explanation=If you need to cut speed in a hurry, use your space brake - it's much quicker than dialing back your engines and the moment you let go of it you'll automatically accelerate back up to your previous speed.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_spire_fillerTraining_1470_Filler_And_Foreshadow_The_Spire=That, my friend, is the Spire. Isn't she a beauty?
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_strafe_forwardTraining_0090_Take_Off_Move_Forward=Now that I'm clear I can strafe forward onto the taxiway.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_target_hud_explanationTraining_0490_Combat_Target_Enemy_Hud_Explanation_01=Okay, now look at the top right of your HUD. You should see you target displayed. This will show realtime damage, shield status and a few other things.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_target_hud_explanation_2Training_0490_Combat_Target_Enemy_Hud_Explanation_02=Shields are drawn as panels floating around the ship. They'll shrink as they weaken until they disappear completely. At that point, your shots will hit the hull and cause lasting damage.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_target_leaderTraining_0320_Targeting_Intro_01=I've just enabled your targeting system. Use it to target me.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_target_lines_upTraining_0540_Combat_Target_Fire_When_Ready_01=Line up your target and fire when you're ready.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_too_much_damageTraining_0310_Take_Off_Too_Much_Damage=Yeah, I don't think your ship can take any more. I think we'll need to get it patched up and try again.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_vanduul_all_deadTraining_1380_Combat_Vanduul_All_Dead=We're clear. Hell of a training session, huh.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_vanduul_intro_2Training_1240_Combat_Vanduul_Contact=Contact! Vanduul fighter, dead ahead.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_vanduul_intro_3Training_1250_Combat_All_Weapon_Systems_Active=This is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill. All your systems are active. This is a live-fire encounter.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_vanduul_wave_2Training_1320_Combat_Vanduul_Wave_Two=Stay sharp. We got more hostiles inbound. Looks like there's a Glaive in the mix.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_vertical_lift_offTraining_0080_Take_Off_Dust_Off=Alright, first I want to lift vertically until I'm just clear of the landing pad.
