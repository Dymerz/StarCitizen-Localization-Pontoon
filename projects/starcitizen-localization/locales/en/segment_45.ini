Livingston\nRISK ASSESSMENT: High\nRUSH CONTRACT: Yes\n\nHurston has learned that the Nine Tails are attacking ~mission(Location|address). Our on-site forces have suffered heavy casualties and stopped responding to comms. Initial reports indicated that the gang was attempting to obtain confidential material recently delivered to the facility. Thankfully, we have security measures in place that should give us time to respond. We need an operative to head to the facility immediately, retrieve those boxes, and deliver them to a secure location.\n\nYou and whatever backup you choose to bring are authorized to take any actions necessary when confronting the trespassers. Suspects are considered armed and dangerous. Hurston will not provide material support and/or updates regarding the status of the facility's security forces. \n\nThe confidential materials were discreetly delivered alongside other boxes in a consignment and locked in our automated vault. The retrieval codes needed to access them are kept on datapads held by senior security staff. Find those datapads and then enter the consignment codes at the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. Payment will be sent once all confidential materials have been delivered to ~mission(dropoff1|address). \n\n\n** The information transmitted may contain confidential and/or privileged material.

Independent Contractor is not required to maintain a personal appearance to participate in an action brought hereunder and can attend by remote conference and/or correspondence, as appropriate under the circumstances.  In the event that applicable law explicitly requires a matter to be addressed to the Independent Arbitrator’s Guild, the Parties stipulate that the conduct of any such conflict resolution process may be conducted by remote in lieu of any relocation or change of venue from the Commercial Territory of the planet of Hurston.\n\n16)  General Terms: All material received from or on behalf of the Company pursuant to the Contract must be returned to a Company operations center in the same condition in which they were received.  Failure to do so may be considered a breach of the Contract and considered stolen or otherwise misappropriated; Company reserves all rights under law and equity to engage measures and actions necessary to retrieve any and all property, physical, material, intellectual, or otherwise.  The parties agree that the Contract as well as any associated terms herein do not constitute a contract of adhesion.  The parties agree that the Contract and any amendments thereto represent the totality of the complete agreement between Company and Independent Contractor without resort to extrinsic evidence.  This Contract is enforceable to the maximum extent permissible by law; if any part of the Contract is deemed unenforceable, that part shall be stricken and the rest of the contract shall continue in full force and effect with any remaining ambiguities interpreted in favor of Company’s intentions as best determined through the resort to extrinsic evidence if necessary.  After completion or termination of the Contract, Sections 5, 8, 9, 11, 14, and 15 remain in effect in perpetuity. Severability and whole agreement.\n\n
