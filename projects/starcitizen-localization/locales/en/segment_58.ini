mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc_001=A tremendous opportunity seems to have landed... well crashed in our favor. A Hurston satellite has quite ungracefully plummeted to the surface. Thankfully, it appears that a ~mission(Item) has miraculously survived the incident.\n\nNow, I know that there are plenty of Hurston's rivals who would be... eager... to get an advance look at this tech. I'm sure I could convince them to pay handsomely for an opportunity like this, but I'll need you to retrieve it. You can start your search at the ~mission(Location) and work out from there. \n\nOnce recovered, you will only have a short time to upload the information from the ~mission(Item) using the decryption software on a designated Hurston server before its security protocols cause it to self-destruct. Your best bet will be to access a data center inside one of the storage facilities that dot the surface of the planet. They typically have minimal security so I don't foresee you running into any issues. \n\nNeedless to say, I will pay you handsomely upon completion and we can both bask in knowledge that Hurston has been hit where it hurts.\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)
mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc_002=I managed to intercept an interesting bit of news coming over the comms. It seems Hurston's fortunes are falling quite literally; one of their satellites has crashed to the surface. Not all is lost however, for the valuable ~mission(Item) onboard appears to have survived the impact.  \n\nNow, this is one of those moments where enterprising individuals face a choice. Either do nothing, let Hurston reclaim their property and let this wretched world keep turning or seize the opportunity to capitalize. Personally, I'm leaning towards the latter and I'm hoping you feel the same. \n\nIf you were to obtain the part from the ~mission(location) before Hurston does, I'm sure I could find some parties interested in paying handsomely for a sneak peek at Hurston's hard work.\n\nOne catch (as always), is that in order to safely decrypt and extract the data, you must connect it to an official Hurston server before its security protocols cause it to self-destruct. I recommend using a storage facilities data terminal. They tend to be easier to access than anything that can be found in Lorville proper. Once the transfer is complete, I will issue your just rewards.\n\nBest of luck,\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)
mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc_003=My Dear Compatriot,\n\nWonderful tidings. It seems that we have received an unexpected but most welcomed guest - a Hurston satellite has been ejected from orbit and crashed practically straight into our laps. Most importantly, the ~mission(Item) onboard has survived intact.  \n\nNow, it just so happens that this cutting-edge Prototype has been long desired by some deep-pocketed associates of mine. If you were able to acquire this wayward Blade from the ~mission(Location) before Hurston manages to do so, I could ensure significant restitution for your time and troubles.\n\nThe only real wrinkle is that the information on the Prototype is inaccessible (and will self-destruct) unless connected to an official Hurston server. Fortunately, there is access to the said server dotted around the planet inside Hurston Storage Facilities. It should be short work for you to get the Blade and then take it to the server for decryption and extraction. Once the data transfer is finished, I will happily transfer the well-earned credits into your account. \n\nSafe travels,\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)

mg_miles_planetcollect_drug_desc_0001=So here's the deal. I don't normally like to get mixed up with this stuff, but a job's a job, right? Anyway, there's a shipment of ~mission(item) down on ~mission(location). I need it moved to ~mission(destination). That's it. No questions. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_miles_planetcollect_drug_desc_0002=Job's pretty simple. Need you to go to ~mission(location), grab a box and run it to ~mission(destination). I'm gonna tell you up front, the box is full of ~mission(item), so don't do anything stupid and get yourself caught, okay? Once it's done, I'll transfer the money. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_miles_planetcollect_drug_desc_0003=This is a straight up boxman job. Run a crate of ~mission(item) from ~mission(location) over to ~mission(destination) and get paid. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_miles_planetcollect_drug_desc_0004=Some lowlife's paying serious creds to move a crate of ~mission(item) from ~mission(location) to ~mission(destination). Knock it out and be done with it. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_miles_planetcollect_drug_desc_0005=I need a courier to run some product from ~mission(location) to ~mission(destination). Don't look in the box and don't ask questions. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_miles_planetcollect_drug_desc_0006=Guess the ~mission(item) junkies are getting desperate. Some dealers need a pickup from ~mission(location) run over to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble) These guys are scum, but they're paying well, so I figured, what the hell.
mg_miles_planetcollect_drug_desc_0007=Gonna need you to run a box of ~mission(item) from ~mission(location) to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)Keep a low profile and we'll both get paid.
mg_miles_planetcollect_drug_desc_0008=Job's don't get much simpler than this. Go to ~mission(location), pick up a box and take it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)That's it. Credits will be transferred upon completion. Ask no questions and you'll hear no lies.
mg_miles_planetcollect_drug_desc_0009=Client needs some of their product moved from ~mission(location) to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)Shouldn't be a problem, so don't make it one.
