Covalex_Danger_001=One more thing, I'm seeing here that you'll be working in a heightened safety area. I'm sure you always follow best practices, but a little extra caution probably wouldn't be a bad idea. Better safe than sorry, right! 
Covalex_Danger_002=One last thing, it looks like some of our previous operators have reported outlaw activity in the area. Might be a good idea to plan for some extra security precautions. But if you do get into a situation (though you probably won't!), remember Covalex's policy of 'Flight, not fight.' 
Covalex_Danger_003=Also, unfortunately, it seems a security flag has been placed on this contract. Nothing to worry about too much... but that said, you should probably at least be extra careful during this job. Be ready for anything and you'll never be surprised! 
Covalex_Danger_004=One more little wrinkle. The system has flagged this contract as potentially hazardous. It might not mean anything, but don't be too surprised if you run into a bump or two or three while completing this one. 
Covalex_Danger_005=Last thing. This contract has been given a security flag. They add those when there is a higher risk involved. Sometimes it's hazardous routes, sometimes outlaw sightings, but you're going to want to be extra sharp on this one.

Covalex_QuantumSensitiveDelivery_Desc_001=Hi,\n\nWe are in a bit of a tight spot, over here at Covalex. A shipment of Diluthermex was accidentally delivered to the wrong location and we're looking to get it delivered correctly as quickly as possible. It's the least we can do for our clients. \n\nNow the tricky bit of business is that Diluthermex is a bit unstable when exposed to quantum travel.\n\nNormally, we would have a fully kitted cargo ship handle the delivery, but since time is of the essence, I'm hoping you can do it and just not QT while you have it aboard your craft. Not ideal, but as long as you have a full tank of fuel you should be fine.\n\nHere are the details -\n\n~mission(Itinerary)\n\nRemember, slow and steady but as fast as possible!\n\nChase Hewitt\nJr. Logistics Coordinator\nCovalex Shipping  \n'Anything you need, anywhere you need it.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovalex Shipping is a limited liability corporation.

Covalex Shipping is not responsible for any damages that occur while operating as an independent contractor.
Covalex_QuantumSensitiveDelivery_Desc_002=Hi,\n\nGot a problem that I'm really hoping you can help me sort out. \n\nA shipment of Diluthermex was mistakenly delivered to the wrong address and they need be correctly delivered as soon as possible. \n\nTo further complicate things, as you may or may not know, Diluthermex is quantum sensitive which means that you either need a properly shielded hold or you can't QT with it onboard. \n\nUsually, I would bring in a contractor who had the proper set up, but with everything already so delayed, I'm just going to trust you to deliver these the old fashion way.\n\nHere are the details -\n\n~mission(Itinerary)\n\nAnd since you're going to be flying at regular speeds, I definitely recommend making sure to top off your fuel tank before heading out. Don't want to get stranded half way.\n\nThanks again for helping me out of this bind!\n\nChase Hewitt\nJr. Logistics Coordinator\nCovalex Shipping  \n'Anything you need, anywhere you need it.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovalex Shipping is a limited liability corporation.

Covalex Shipping is not responsible for any damages that occur while operating as an independent contractor.
Covalex_QuantumSensitiveDelivery_Desc_003=Hi,\n\nSo it seems that some forms got processed incorrectly and a shipment of Diluthermex was mistakenly delivered to the wrong address. Unfortunately, we only realized the mistake after the original transport ship left the system and now I need another pilot to correctly finish the delivery.\n\nThe reason why it would have been better for the original ship to take care of this is that delivery was quantum sensitive Diluthermex. Without the proper shielding, I'm afraid you'll have to make the deliveries without using your quantum drives or risk damaging the shipment (and your ship). \n\nHere are the details -\n\n~mission(Itinerary)\n\nBut hey, flying a little bit slower can be nice sometimes. Just think about all the pretty views! As long as you got a full tank of fuel, why not sit back and enjoy the flight. \n\nAppreciate your help,\n\nChase Hewitt\nJr. Logistics Coordinator\nCovalex Shipping  \n'Anything you need, anywhere you need it.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovalex Shipping is a limited liability corporation.

Covalex_Reaction_BadStreak_001=You haven't been having much luck out there have you? I don't want to get too overly dramatic, but your performance stats over the last few contracts have been falling well below average. However, your luck hasn't completely run out! Covalex believes firmly in cultivating talent and allowing people to learn from our mistakes ( Thankfully! I probably wouldn't be here otherwise :p ). So, let's put all that behind us as a learning experience and meet the future head on! 
Covalex_Reaction_BadStreak_002=This is part of my job that I do not look forward to. We have to talk about your recent string of contracts. Things have just not been going your way have they?

Let's get you back out there, and see what you can really do. 
Covalex_Reaction_BadToGood_001=Got to say, you really turned it around with that last job! Awesome work! Now, let's just keep it up! 
Covalex_Reaction_BadToGood_002=Congrats on the flipping your performance status around! I was rooting for you, and sure enough, you really proved on that last job that when push comes to shove, you can get it done. Now we just got to keep that momentum going! 
Covalex_Reaction_Bad_001=Hate to do this, but wanted to check in about that last contract. Seems like you had some problems. Now, while we all run into unavoidable obstacles from time to time, I'm going to encourage you to take a moment to think about what went wrong and three things that you can improve upon for your next contract. It's a little exercise that always helps me improve my performance, and isn't that what life is about? Self improvement? All right, back to the exciting new business at hand! 
Covalex_Reaction_Bad_002=To get a bit of business out of the way, I briefly wanted to mention your performance on the last contract. I have in my notes that it was less than satisfactory. Probably just an off day, and I sure know about those, but I would like to strongly encourage you to use this contract as an opportunity to show us just how good you really are. 
Covalex_Reaction_GoodStreak_001=I was looking back through my records and wow! You've been doing a fantastic job recently. I've talked about you to some of the other Jr. Logistics Operators, and you didn't hear it from me, but they're pretty jealous I'm working with such a stellar contractor. Keep this up and we'll both be Covalex stars! 
Covalex_Reaction_GoodStreak_002=First off, I want to let you know how much I, and everyone here at Covalex Shipping, really appreciate the hard work you've been putting in. You've consistently have been completing contracts above and beyond my expectations. Alright, that's probably enough stroking your ego! 
Covalex_Reaction_GoodToBad_001=I'm going to confess, I was a little surprised seeing that report come in from your last contract. You had been doing so well! For now, let's just call it a fluke and focus on the next job, okay? 
Covalex_Reaction_GoodToBad_002=I have to ask - were you as disappointed about that last contract as I was? You had such a good record going! But don't worry. Everyone makes mistakes. It's what we do with those mistakes that matter. It's like that saying - "I'd rather try and fail, than fail to try." 
Covalex_Reaction_Good_001=My records show that you did a great job with that last contract! I personally wanted to say well done. It's that kind of performance that Covalex really loves to see. 
Covalex_Reaction_Good_002=Wanted to take a second to say that you did a stellar job with that last contract and that your hard work is not going unnoticed! 
Covalex_Reaction_LastWarning_001=So, with your recent performance issues, I'm afraid that if you don't turn things around, Covalex will be putting you on a probationary disciplinary period and remove you from active contractor status. But don't worry, this contract is you're chance show us how dedicated you are to meeting Covalex Shipping's high standards. I'm sure you'll do great. 
Covalex_Reaction_LastWarning_002=There's a bit of bad news. I've received notice that your time with Covalex may be transitioning to a less 'active' role. Seems that your track record hasn't been all that satisfactory. Good news is that it's not too late for you to change people's minds! You knock this next contract into the goal, and it'll show you still have some tricks up your sleeves. 
Covalex_Reaction_Renew_001=I know it's been a little while since we last spoke, but I'm happy to report that my manager has agreed to allow you to do another 'Evaluation Trial' to regain active status as a Covalex Independent Contractor. I'm a firm believer in giving people another chance to prove themselves, and this is yours! 
Covalex_Reaction_Renew_002=I've got some good news. We were directed to go through our probationary contractors list and see if there were candidates who we felt deserved to be reconsidered. You immediately came to mind! What do you say? You ready to wipe the slate clean and give it another try? 
Covalex_RepUI_Area=UEE
Covalex_RepUI_Description=Covalex is one of the largest hauling companies in the ’verse; thanks to its policy of contracting with independent ship operators.

I tried to hack into the servers on the Black Kite to see if they copied the data, but couldn't find a way to remotely get past their encryption protocols without the physical key.\n\nThat's where you come in.

Crus_HistMarker_From=Crusader Historical Society
Crus_HistMarker_Text_01=Famed musician Carolyn 'Vortex' Thorson was born here on January 8, 2915. Her family's ship was en route to a nearby outpost when it set down to facilitate her birth. As a teenager, Thorson earned the nickname 'Vortex' for the impressive speed and dexterity she displayed behind the drums. As a founding member of Firmament, she helped redefine popular music, making her the most famous and mimicked drummer in the UEE for over a decade.   
Crus_HistMarker_Text_02=Rayari scientists working here at the Hickes Research Outpost created a revolutionary nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) in 2938. The drug, known commonly as Ceprozin, has become widely used during cybernetic replacement surgeries, providing pain relief and curbing inflammation without any of the side effects common with other NSAIDs.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_03=Here, in 2941, Terra Mills researchers combined Cellin's unique soil composition with genetic augmentation to create a new fruit hybrid named the Terraberry. This uniquely tart, purple berry stays ripe longer than most other berries, making it ideal for interstellar shipping.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_04=Here sits the shelter that saved Bastien Nemitz. In 2930, Crusader Industries hired the noted adventurer to promote the beauty and diversity of their moons by hiking around each one and providing daily updates. Following successful journeys around Cellin and Yela, Nemitz failed to upload a daily diary from Yela on June 24th. A search party was organized but failed to find him. Days later, Nemitz contacted Crusader authorities from this shelter. He'd limped here on a shattered ankle suffering during a terrible fall that also destroyed his mobi. After he was rescued, Nemitz recovered and returned to the Talarine Divide shelter to complete his journey around Yela.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_05=This shelter was erected in part due to the generous contributions of Ethan Halton's friends and families. The large boulders and rocks that dot the Nakamura Valley have made it a popular destination for unregulated open canopy racers. Sadly, in 2917, amateur racer Ethan Halton, unable to handle the track's successive tight turns, died from injuries sustained during a racing crash. To help ensure that other racers would not share Ethan's fate, in 2918, this emergency shelter was erected.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_06=Mario Kosso was the first head of Crusader's emergency response unit. Established to provide support and rescue services to those who found themselves in need on Crusader's moons, Kosso lead the response to the team's first distress beacon, which came from this basin. It was named in his honor upon his retirement in 2938.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_07=The famous picture of Yela's ring illuminated against the darkened sky was taken here by noted photographer Juliana Aston in 2918. The vista became so connected to her artwork that in 2928 it was officially named 'Aston Ridge' in her honor.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_08=Situated above a junction of multiple canyons, Wolf Point earned its name thanks to Crusader surveyor Cally Stroble who had noted excitedly in her initial report that "Against all odds, it seems a family of wolf-like creatures somehow has found a way to settle the area. Their cries can be heard for kilometers around." However, when further investigation proved that the wolves were merely a prank by a fellow surveyor, the name stuck.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_09=This ridge was named for Crusader's former CEO August Dunlow. Many credit Dunlow's vision as instrumental into transforming Crusader Industries into the company it is today. With that in mind, Dunlow Ridge, with its expansive view of the Daymar landscape, was named in his honor.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_10=This section of Daymar became known as Eager Flats after an eccentric artist who called it home. Norman Eager gained notoriety in the 2920s for constructing a series of art installations so massive they could be seen by ships flying above the flats. Deemed 'ephemeral art' by Eager, the pieces were not meant to be permanent. Instead, they were slowly degraded and buried by the moon's constantly swirling sands.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_11=The Tamdon Plains were named in honor of Advocacy agent Crista Tamdon, who in 2912 was killed in the line of duty after being ambushed while crossing these plains in pursuit of a suspect.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_12=From 2923 to 2927, a mysterious benefactor took it upon themselves to see that this emergency shelter was stocked with jars of homemade marmalade. First reported by a stranded pilot, as word spread many other travelers would visit the shelter to try the jam for themselves. In 2927, when a reporter attempted to learn who was leaving the sweet treat, the marmalade supply stopped as mysteriously as it began. However, the tradition has been kept alive to this day by the many visitors who continue to leave preserves at the site.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_13=Crusader's former lead ship designer, Shelly Ashburn, became enamored with this location for its picturesque angle of Crusader on the horizon. She often visited the spot to channel her creative energy, earning it the nickname, Ashburn Channel, among her team. Following her retirement in 2940, the site officially adopted the title.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_14=In 2936, Crusader Industries sponsored a competition to find the best travelogue focused on one of their moons. Donnell Flanagan's account of his exciting experiences took top prize and this location, which featured heavily in his adventures, was named in his honor.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_15=Crusader CEO Kelly Caplan loved the landscape on this part of Cellin and requested that this ravine be named for her dog, Julep.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_16=Here on August 25th, 2912, Lakedra Walsh organized and won the first ground vehicle race on Yela. The track became famous among ground vehicle racing enthusiasts and subsequently the site of the first official race track on the moon.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_17=On this site in 2906, Darnell Ajay built the first permanent homestead on Daymar.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_18=On this site in 2906, Phillip Xu built the first permanent homestead on Cellin.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_19=On this site in 2907, Wilma Ivery built the first permanent homestead on Yela.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_20=Advocacy agents, alongside Hurston and Crusader Security forces, pursued Amir Tremaine after he crash-landed into this canyon on Oct. 23, 2929. The wanted fugitive used pieces of his ship to hastily construct a makeshift fortification. Thus began a dramatic, three-day standoff against law enforcement officers which garnered non-stop spectrum coverage up until the final, bloody moments when the Advocacy tried but failed, to take Tremaine alive.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_21=Here on October 2nd, 2904, Chad Fawley ended the first successful solo, circumnavigation of Cellin in a ground vehicle.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_22=In 2934, Esther Hurston was kidnapped and put into a stasis pod by outlaws looking to extract a hefty ransom from her family. The ship holding the twelve-year-old's cryo-pod hid here after its reg-tags were compromised. While one outlaw attempted to procure clean reg-tags, salvager Mac Petrosky discovered the ship. He reported its location and even hid nearby to keep an eye on the ship until authorities arrived on the scene. Petrosky was awarded a Commendation from Crusader Security upon the reunion of Esther and her family.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_23=The infamous Beringer Brothers nicknamed this the "Goodbye Geyser" after repeatedly using it to dispose of those opposed to their criminal enterprises during the early 2920s. It's believed to be the final resting place for at least 14 individuals including famed bounty hunter, Bree Kuznetsov. Attempts to recover remains from the site have proven unsuccessful.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_24=Here in 2909, famed botanist Bryan Shakir began his work cataloguing the diverse flora of Daymar. Published as "Daymar in Bloom: A Flora Field Guide to Stanton 2b," it is still considered by many to be the definitive source on the subject.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_25=Erma Triolo was born on this site in 2909, making her the first person to be born on Yela. Her parents, Albert and Nora Triolo, had traveled to the moon to participate in a race when Nora went into labor. Unable to fly to the nearest medical facilitate for the birth, Albert landed their Constellation at this location and successfully served as midwife.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_26=Prior to Crusader's purchase of the gas giant and its moons, the UEE Navy controlled this part of the system. Here, in 2904, the UEE Navy established a military installation to support and watch over the shipyards perched in Crusader's upper atmosphere. The facilities were retired and relocated in 2908.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_27=Strained relations between Hurston and their workforce in late 2927-2929 resulted in a series of riots. In response, Hurston severely limited traffic to and from the planet for nearly 15 standard months. Many workers wished to escape the dangerous situation, but few had the means. One bright spot was the Hurston Hotline, a comm channel that constantly shifted frequency. Those looking to flee the unrest, and lucky enough to know the current channel frequency, could request help leaving the planet. Specific instructions were delivered in person to volunteer pilots and had to be followed exactly. The network of labor activists responsible for the Hurston Hotline during this tumultuous time used this location to shelter fleeing workers prior to moving them out of the system.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_28=Cellin was named after the youngest sibling in the classic children's story A Gift for Baba,the moon's many dormant volcanoes embodying the character's simmering anger. This dormant volcano, named Cellin's Peak by volcanologists, is carefully watched and monitored as it is believed to have a high chance of one day becoming active. 
Crus_HistMarker_Text_29=Daymar was named after the middle brother in A Gift for Baba. Known for his tendency to get lost, the character's name was also given to this twisting canyon by early explorers. 
Crus_HistMarker_Text_30=Yela was named after the eldest sibling in A Gift for Baba, who is known for her cool and calculated demeanor. This expansive plain produced the coldest temperature recorded by the first scientific expedition to the moon, earning it the name Yela's Plain. 
Crus_HistMarker_Text_31=The study of Cellin's geysers began with an observation station constructed on this location in 2908. Geologist Randell Engler spent nearly a decade investigating these natural wonders. He was first to hypothesize that the moon's geyser played an important role in dispersing vital nutrients and minerals into the soil.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_32=During Imperator Costigan's 2944 trip to the Stanton System, he shared a meal here at Gallete Family Farms. Imperator Costigan hoped his visit would draw attention to the hardworking, independent farmers across the Empire that would benefit from the agricultural subsidies legislation being debated by the Senate at the time.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_33=In 2927, Fakih Borisov introduced a herd of large, genetically modified land crabs to Daymar. Breed to withstand the moon's dry conditions, the crabs roamed this part of Daymar for nearly a decade, but Borisov's dream of turning the moon into a rancher's paradise never came to fruition. A key component to Borisov's plan was for the crab to graze on the moon's limited natural vegetation, yet doing so imbued the animals with an off-putting odor that clung to any products derived from them.  
Crus_HistMarker_Text_34=On August 22, 2924, amateur archaeologist Sonny Pak revealed a fossil that he claimed belonged to a new sentient species that inhabited this moon. News of the discovery spread across the spectrum and excited the scientific community. However, instead of allowing scientists to examine the specimen, Sonny took the remains on a publicity tour and even sold tickets to those who wished to view them. His actions were condemned by the scientific community and, after the intervention of the UEE government, the fossil was proven to be a fake.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_35=Romantics believe that lovers who profess their affection for each other on this ledge will be together forever. This legend has its origin in the macabre tale of notorious outlaw couple Akiko 'Jackal' Bazin and Rick 'Shady' Milligan. In 2913, mere moments away from capture, the pair decided to avoid imprisonment and instead leapt to their death while holding hands.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_36=On December 31, 2940, the Stanton Knights sataball team landed here so their ship could undergo emergency repairs. While waiting, the team strategized for their championship match against the Kiel Guardians scheduled for the following day. According to team members, it was here that the Knights conceived of the now famous 'Franklin Flip' play that would propel the team to victory and the first SBPL championship in the club's history.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_37=On March 17, 2904, Meiko Norwood collapsed here while loading soil samples into her ship. She passed away later that day due to complications with an artificial heart valve, making her the first person to die on Daymar.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_38=In 2939, Crusader Security apprehended a fugitive here who was wanted in connection with a massive theft of credit chits. The money wasn't recovered during the arrest, but rumors swirled that the outlaw was in possession of digging implements. Ever since, treasure hunters have flocked here in search of the lost fortune, even though repeated scans have failed to show any sign of it. \n\nCrusader Industries discourages people from digging up the area and asks that any displaced ground be placed back where it came from to preserve the moon's natural beauty.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_39=The long lost Greg Caldwell painting "The Starman's Farewell" was discovered buried underneath a stone cairn on this site in 2908. Stolen from the Terra Museum of Contemporary Art in 2731, it remains a mystery as to how the work of art ended up here. The painting was returned to Terra.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_40=In 2945, independent miner Bruce Amodeo discovered a large serendibite gemstone near this outpost. Its sale at auction to an anonymous buyer broke records for the most credits per carat spent on a serendibite. Ever since, miners have flocked to the region in search of further serendibite deposits.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_41=Tragedy struck the Cuadrado outpost on May 15, 2941, due to a malfunctioning life support system. An excess of oxygen leaking into the outpost was sparked, resulting in an explosion that took nine lives. The catastrophe drove Crusader Industries to tighten regulations on outposts and mandate more frequent maintenance checks on all facilities.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_42=Crusader Industries commends Bountiful Harvest Hydroponics for their extraordinary response to those in need on Vega. Following the horrific Vanduul attacks on October 5, 2945, Bountiful Harvest produced and donated more emergency food supplies for the Vega relief effort than any other outpost on Crusader's moons. This outpost's extraordinary sacrifice serves as a reminder that the UEE will always stand behind those who come face-to-face with the Vanduul threat.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_43=Famed actress and noted naturist, Millicent Silverton, would often come to this remote area to camp in the wilderness. She was so fond of the site that she petitioned for its inclusion in the 2941 film "Onto the Break."
Crus_HistMarker_Text_44=The geysers here feature a unique set of small fissures, that when the pressure builds up to a specific amount, make a sound similar to moaning. It is this phenomenon that has lead to the erroneous rumors that the site is haunted.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_45=In 2932, this site hosted the infamous Slim Chance Rally. This gathering of Greycat buggy enthusiasts come together once a year in a remote location to compete in an illicit destruction derby.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_46=Crusader Industries often uses this location and its irregular terrain to field test their new ship designs' landing systems. It was here on March 25th, 2934, that the first and only landing of the failed Juno ship design occurred.

DXSH_MCAV_Ad_ANVL_Hornet_Commercial,P=Legendary Fighter Pilot Area Riley once said Give me a fully loaded Hornet, and I ll shake the gates of Heaven.\n\nAnvil Aerospaces Hornets have faced Vanduul, Shion, Pirates and Criminals.\n\nAnvil Aerospaces Hornets have logged more combat time and kills in more theatres than any other ship in the history of Space Combat.\n\nBattle Tested in the harshest conditions, the Hornet has proven time and again its ability to withstand damage, and still be able to dish it out.\n\nWith all the punishment it handles on a daily basis, don=t you think the new Hornet can handle yours\n\nAnvil s New Hornet F7C, see your authorized ship dealer for options.
DXSH_MCAV_Ad_CNOU_Mustang_Commercial,P=We are drawn towards the familiar. It is safe, reliable.\n\nBut it can shackle us to the ordinary when in our souls we long to strike out and become something new.\n\nWe started with a simple match. Dare to dream. Dare to challenge the expectations of what has come before. \n\nTo embrace the Unique, to put everything on the line.\n\nOnly when we risk everything can we discover something truly special, and redefine what it means to drive with the stars.\n\nTo explore the farthest reaches, to race on the cutting edge, to Protect what you love.\n\nSay goodbye to the familiar, and welcome the brand new Mustang, where risk, meets reward.
DXSH_MCAV_Ad_ORIG_M50_Commercial,P=Space, the best ships gracefully dance across its expense, the worst clumsily plod across its face. The new M50 doesnt have time for any of that.\n\nInstead, it simply slices its way through.The 2944 M50 was designed with one goal in mind: Make the ship that will win the next Murray Cup.\n\nThe surprising thing is, Origin may have just about done it.\n\nThe stats are an orgy of mind-bending numbers but it comes down to two things. Less weight and more power. Youll notice the nose cone has grown what I can only describe as a mustache, added to stabilize all the additional thrust that the retooled and updated Twin Hammer HM4point3 drives spew out. And the refinement doesnt stop there.\n\nThey ve narrowed the front fuselage, moved the wings forward for better balance, shaved the cockpit viewpane down to the finest it could still be and not shatter in your face.\n\nThe result. A pure flying machine. Each movement on the stick translates directly into unadulterated throttle action. Welcome back to the glory days of flying.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_First_Blood_03,P=Strike first, strike hard.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Gain_Player_01,P=Looks like we got ourselves a new recruit.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Gain_Player_02,P=Got a new Marine joining our ranks.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Game_Objective_Briefing_01,P=Listen up, we got hostiles inside. This is elimination, we don't go home until they're put down.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Game_Objective_Briefing_02,P=We need this area cleared of all combatants. Terminate every last one of these outlaws with extreme prejudice.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Lose_Player_02,P=Orders came in. One of your squadmate's been reassigned.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Loss_01,P=I call that mission a complete failure. I think you're better than that, I think you know that too. 
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Loss_02,P=You all tried your best, and this time it wasn't good enough. But there's a lesson to be learned in that. Make sure that you learn it.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Loss_03,P=We lost today. No getting around that. The important part is what comes next. Are you going to carry defeat with you, or are you going to rise above it?
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Loss_04,P=I am dissapointed in all of you. You let the UEE and the Marines down. Not just cause those outlaws got the better of us, but because I know you can do better. It's up to you to prove me right.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Loss_05,P=Those outlaws made a mockery of us today. That doesn't sit well with me, and sure as heck hope it doesn't sit well with you either. Remember that feeling next time you go to battle and use it.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Win_01,P=Let me be the first to say well done. You went in with a job to do, and you sure as heck did it.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Win_03,P=This operation wasn't just a success, it was a thing of beauty. Each and every one of you poured your blood and sweat into it, and let me tell you, that means something. I'm proud of you. 
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Win_04,P=Mission accomplished. But that's just what Marines do, isn't it? Pack it up, and let's go home.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Win_05,P=That was some fine work you did out there today, and thanks to you, those outlaws won't be a problem anymore. All of you should feel proud of yourselves.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_Start_01,P=Ready up, op is a go.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Multi_Kill_01,P=There we go. Who's got time to kill 'em one by one.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Multi_Kill_02,P=Damn. How many was that?
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Multi_Kill_03,P=That'll teach them not to bunch together.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Need_Medic_01,P=Marine down and in need of medical.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Need_Medic_02,P=We've got an injured Marine in need of help.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Need_Medic_03,P=Need a medpack, lifesign's critical.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Need_Medic_04,P=Marine down. Marine down.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_03,P=I ain't gonna surgar coat it, that was a mess. Learn from it. Don't let it happen again.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_04,P=We may've lost the battle, but we sure as hell can still win this war.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_05,P=We lost control of the situation. That can't happen. Next time, we need to focus, and we need to work together. 
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_Shutout_01,P=That was a complete bloodbath of epic proportions. Consider me dissapointed.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_Shutout_02,P=They completely dismantled our operation six ways from Sunday. We need to be better than that.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_Shutout_03,P=What the hell did I just witness? That went about as wrong as wrong can go.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_01,P=We got them that time, but stay focused. This ain't over yet.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_02,P=And that is how you stop a threat dead in it's tracks. Well done.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_03,P=Mark one in the Win column.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_04,P=That was one heck of a fight, but don't get cocky. There's plenty more work to do..
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_05,P=We put them in their place for now, but that's not going to stop them for long. Just another day on the job. Let's do it again.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_Shutout_01,P=In and out, and not a single Marine down. Couldn't ask for a better op.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_Shutout_02,P=That was near flawlass work, and you all deserve accomendations, but that comes later. Now we need to stay focus, It only takes one lucky shot to change everything.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_Shutout_03,P=All that training really paid off. You put down those outlaws before they even had a chance to know what hit them.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_Start_01,P=You waitin' for an invitation?!? Get out there!
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_Start_02,P=Move out!
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_Start_03,P=Go! Go! Go!
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_Start_04,P=We are go!
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_Start_05,P=Roll out.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_Start_Countdown_01,P=Here we go. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Move out!

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Encouragement_01,P=Don't punk out now.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Encouragement_02,P=Take a breath. You got this.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Encouragement_03,P=It's us or them. Remember that.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Good_Kill_05,P=That was fun to watch.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Good_Kill_06,P=They won't be gettin' up anytime soon.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Greetings_01,P=Hey, shut up for a second.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Greetings_02,P=Who's ready to have a little fun?
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Greetings_03,P=Everyone here? Good.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Halftime_01,P=We're gonna hit them from a different angle. Get ready.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Halftime_02,P=Time to mix it up. Let's go at 'em from the other side.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Kill_Assist_01,P=Someone totally nicked your kill.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Kill_Assist_02,P=Clippin' 'em ain't the same as finishing 'em, but it's all the same to me.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Kill_Assist_03,P=Seems like you couldn't get the job done yourself.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Killing_Spree_01,P=That's some bloodlust right there.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Killing_Spree_02,P=Ravenous. I like that.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Killing_Spree_03,P=Don't stop 'til your heart stops beating.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Last_Player_Alive_01,P=Take a sec. Breathe. It's you or nothin'.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Last_Player_Alive_02,P=Time to hero up.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Loss_01,P=You're lucky they killed you because I wanna do so much worse.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Loss_02,P=(off-mic) I ain't goin' back! (exchange of gunfire)
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Loss_03,P=Go, go, go let's get outta here.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Loss_04,P=I set us up, make a perfect plan, and you just had to go and mess it up didn't you?
