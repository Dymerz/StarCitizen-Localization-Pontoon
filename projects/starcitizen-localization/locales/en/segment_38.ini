ProtLife_TimeSensitive_Recover_Desc_001=A claim has been processed for a ~mission(Location) belonging to one of our policy holders after the vessel was recently rendered inoperable.\n\nHowever, Olympus Principal has learned that there may still be valuable packages of zeta-prolanide onboard in a salvageable state. The successful salvage of these materials would go a long way in helping us recuperate our expenses, and as such, we are seeking a contractor to perform the retrieval operation on our behalf.\n\nAs you may know, zeta-prolanide is extremely volatile. If it is not kept in a powered stabilizer, it will grow dangerously unstable over time. We believe that salvage from ~mission(Location|Address) should still be stable for a little while longer, but be mindful as soon as they are removed you will only have a limited amount of time to deliver them to ~mission(Destination|Address). \n\nWhen approaching the incident site, please be on alert in case dangerous or hostile elements are still present.
ProtLife_TimeSensitive_Recover_Desc_002=Olympus Principal is seeking a salvage team to remove valuable packages of zeta-prolanide from a recently lost ~mission(Location). The hope is that the recovery of these materials will be able to offset any expenditures related to our client's claim of loss.\n\nAs you may know, if zeta-prolanide is not kept in a powered stabilizer it becomes extremely volatile over time. This will make any salvage attempt more complicated. \n\nOnce the containers are removed from ~mission(Location|Address) you will only have a limited amount of time to deliver them to ~mission(Destination|Address) before they become dangerously unstable. \n\nThere is a chance that word of this valuable salvage has gotten out to other interested parties and it is recommended that you proceed with caution in case there are hostiles present.
ProtLife_TimeSensitive_Recover_Desc_003=An inoperable vehicle claim has recently been filed by one of our clients for a ~mission(Location). The vessel was lost while transporting valuable packages of zeta-prolanide. It is our belief that those containers are still intact, and as the current property owner, Olympus Principal is eager to attempt to salvage them.\n\nWe are seeking professionals to handle this operation on our behalf owing to the dangerous nature of transporting zeta-prolanide once it is removed from a powered stabilizer. After you collect the containers from ~mission(Location|Address) you will only have a limited amount of time to deliver them to ~mission(Destination|Address) before they become dangerously unstable and lose all value to us. Please be very mindful of these time constraints.\n\nNote that other interested parties (possibly hostile) may have gotten word of the valuables onboard the wreckage, and extreme caution should be used in the area.
